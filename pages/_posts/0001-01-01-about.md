Ben Balter is a J.D./M.B.A. candidate at the George Washington University, an open-source developer passionate about the power of digital communications, and a gov 2.0 evangelist working to modernize federal government.

Ben’s currently a Fellow in the Office of the US Chief Information Officer within the Executive Office of the President, and before that served on the SoftWare Automation and Technology (SWAT) Team, the White House’s first and only agile development team, and as a [New Media Fellow][2], in the Federal Communications Commission’s Office of the Managing Director. This past spring, he received a stipend from Google to develop a government- and enterprise-friendly, [open source document management and version control system][3] for WordPress, the content management system that powers more than a quarter of new websites, and most recently, his paper, *[Towards a More Agile Government][4]* was published in the Public Contract Law Journal, arguing that Federal IT Procurement should be more amenable to modern, agile development methods.

An aspiring attorney, a coder, and an all around geek, Ben’s background bridges three distinct disciplines: a formal [legal][5] education and commitment to advocating on behalf of others, a deep-seeded understanding of the intricacies of today’s [business][6] decisions, and a life-long passion for [technology][7]‘s ability to shape how we interact with one another. When not working or in class, he enjoys tackling otherwise-impossible challenges to sharing information using nothing more than duct tape and occasionally a pack of bubblegum.

After graduation, Ben hopes to find an avenue to explore his dual passion for law and technology in the nation’s capital.
