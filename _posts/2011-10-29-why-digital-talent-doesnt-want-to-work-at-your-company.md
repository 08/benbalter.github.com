As Aaron Shapiro over at Fast Company [cogently argues][1], “*it’s because you’re not providing them the right opportunity. The talent you want would be happy to work in an un-air-conditioned garage in New Mexico if it meant the chance to change the world*.”

Specifically he points out:

*   **Every element of their work will be pored over by multiple layers of bureaucracy.** Even if that’s how the rest of the company operates, it can’t spill into the digital department. In a technology environment, new products and businesses spring up daily and a new endeavor can go from conception to launch in a matter of months. Reining in the momentum will be read as inaction and a clear signal the company isn’t willing to grasp the new way of the world.
*   **Mediocre is good enough.** While clocking out at 5 p.m. is attractive to some, it will discourage digital talent. They want to be expected to do something great. They want to be pushed. They care about their work. Their leadership, and those they rely on to get things done, must match their appetite for success.
*   **Trial and error is condemned.** The freedom to try out new ideas allows employees to take initiative, make decisions, and learn from their mistakes. It also demonstrates an attractive and inspiring entrepreneurial spirit.
*   **Your company is structured so it takes a lifetime to get to the top, and as such there are no digital experts in company-wide leadership positions. **Digital talent–often in their 20s and 30s–need to see a clear path for uninhibited career development that’s based on merit, not years spent, and that’s beyond the confines of the digital department. If they don’t, they won’t see a reason to stay with the company in the long term.
*   **Your offices are cold, impersonal and downright stodgy.** It may sound like it conflicts with the “you don’t need to be in Silicon Valley point,” but appreciate the nuance. A traditional office layout is designed to communicate power among certain individuals and barriers between departments. This does not support the collaborative ethos which is intrinsic to the web. Companies should do everything possible to provide the digital team friendlier, open office space. A location in a hip, young neighborhood (which surely exists in every mid- to large-sized city) is also a big plus.

  I think the argument could be extended to hiring 20-somethings more broadly (<a href="http://www.nextgov.com/nextgov/ng_20100423_7313.php">I’m looking at your Federal Government</a>), but a great read, nonetheless.
