As I began to set up my own site, I was not a huge fan of the options out there for adding a resume or CV to a WordPress blog. Many personal Web sites used lackluster TinyMCE formatting (bold, italic, bullets, nothing else) or simply stuffed pre-styled HTML into an existing page. I can’t even begin to fathom the workflows some people must go through every time they want to update their resume <a class="simple-footnote" title="I imagine it would resemble a highly digitized Rube Goldberg  Machine" id="return-note-2020-1" href="#note-2020-1"><sup>1</sup></a>. A few purpose-built plugins offered a slightly more streamlined approach, but cluttered the backend with unnecessary and unfamiliar menus, and spawned legions of database tables to store the data.

*Enter WP Resume…*

WP Resume is an out-of-the-box solution to get your resume online and keep it updated. Built on WordPress 3.0’s custom post type functionality, it offers a uniquely familiar approach to publishing. If you’ve got a WordPress site, you already know how to use WP Resume.
