<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-997" style="padding: 15px 15px 15px 0px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" title="Screenshot of Emphasis WordPress Plugin" src="http://ben.balter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/emphasis-screenshot.png" alt="" width="215" height="247" />The New York Times [recently open-sourced][1] their nifty wizardry which allows users to highlight and link to specific text within an article or post. In their own words:

> Emphasis provides dynamic paragraph-specific anchor links and the ability to highlight text in a document, all of which is made available in the URL hash so it can be emailed, bookmarked, or shared.

I adapted the New York Time’s implementation into a three-line WordPress plugin for my own site, and it is available in the [WordPress plugin repository][2] as a one-click install, if you would like to add it to your own.

The “deep links” plugin allows for permalinking and highlighting of text on a paragraph and sentance level. No need to set anything up. Just install, tap shift twice, and start highlighting.

*See* [The New York Times post on the script][1] for syntax and more information on general usage or you can double tap the *shift* key right now to give it a try.

Neat, huh? [Download it][2] today.

**Update (1/18):** For an interesting perspective on the underlying technology and what it could mean for the net, [Zach Seward’s take][4] is well worth the read.
