This past spring, he received a stipend from Google to develop a government- and enterprise-friendly, <a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/08/29/document-management-version-control-for-wordpress/'>open source document management and version control system</a> for WordPress, the content management system that powers more than a quarter of new websites, and most recently, his paper, <em><a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/11/29/towards-a-more-agile-government/'>Towards a More Agile Government</a></em> was published in the Public Contract Law Journal, arguing that Federal IT Procurement should be more amenable to modern, agile development methods.</p>\n\n<p>An aspiring attorney, a coder, and an all around geek, Ben’s background bridges three distinct disciplines: a formal <a href='http://ben.balter.com/category/law/'>legal</a> education and commitment to advocating on behalf of others, a deep-seeded understanding of the intricacies of today’s <a href='http://ben.balter.com/category/business/'>business</a> decisions, and a life-long passion for <a href='http://ben.balter.com/category/technology/'>technology</a>‘s ability to shape how we interact with one another. When not working or in class, he enjoys tackling otherwise-impossible challenges to sharing information using nothing more than duct tape and occasionally a pack of bubblegum.</p>\n\n<p>After graduation, Ben hopes to find an avenue to explore his dual passion for law and technology in the nation’s capital.</p>\n\n<p>Feel free to e-mail me at <a href='mailto:ben@balter.com'>Ben@Balter.com</a> or you can find me on these social networks:</p>\n\n<p>{% include contact-links.html %}</p>"}
