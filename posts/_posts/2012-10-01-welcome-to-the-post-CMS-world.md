You may notice things are bit snappier around here these days, having [recently converted](https://github.com/benbalter/wordpress-to-jekyll-exporter) the site from WordPress, to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

Jekyll is a blog-aware static site generator, the move to which, was primarily motivated by a desire to embrace the brave new, [post-CMS world](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2012/07/27/build-cms-free-websites/) we find ourselves in. While WordPress is great, [130 outages over the past six months (totalling more than a day's worth of downtime)](http://cl.ly/image/1M420a152e1z), left a bit to be desired in terms of hosting. 

The old site (shared hosting provided by Bluehost) generally served flat HTML files from disk (generated on a regular basis by [W3 Total Cache](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/w3-total-cache/)), but fired up WordPress on every request (on top of the often slugish Apache). 

WordPress can be [configured to fly](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/batcache/) given the right setup, and that's exactly what I set out to do. Spun up a shiny new AWS box, got Nginx with microcache up and running, APC for opcode, page, and object cache, and put everything behind varnish.

But just like Javascript, static sites are coming back in style. Reduce the complexity, push it to the edge, and let the visitor's browser call an API directly to generate any dynamic content you may need. Same functionality, same workflow, no headache.

## The Results

### Homepage

Command: `siege -c 20 -t 30S -b ben.balter.com`

The first test was to benchmark the homepage, the most heavily trafficed page on the site. Given 30 seconds of continuous traffic from 20 concurrent users, Bluehost was able to serve a meager 40 users. AWS managed an impressive 2000 users during that same time period (a 50x performance improvement), and did so twice as fast. Enter Jekyll with more than 2600 users (65x increase), responding on average to each in less than a quarter of a second.

### 404s

Command: `siege -c 20 -t 30S -b ben.balter.com/aaaaaaa/`

The true challenge comes in not from serving a static front page (which is presumably cached by WordPress after the first request), but in what happens when it has to reach into the database to retrieve content, for example, when processing a page that doesn't exist.[^1] Bluehost squeezed out a single response each second, AWS just over 50, and Jekyll didn't flinch at 80.

## Uptime

The other concern was uptime. With the AWS route you may get the performance, but with all that complexity, it's increasingly more like that something would go wrong, harder to diagnose and resolve, and unlike shared or managed hosting, if your site goes down at 3:00 am, the only person to call is yourself. (no thanks.)

With Jekyll, because the files are simply sitting on the server, absent a catastrophic failure, when things go wrong with Jekyll, it simply keeps serving the old content.[^2]
    
[^1]: Requesting a page that doesn't exist will require WordPress to run multiple database queries to attempt to find the page, a request that would most likely not be cached in the event that the 404 was sent in error.

[^2]: GitHub's build queue has been backing up every once in a while as of late, but if a change isn't instantanous, I'm okay with that.
