We've been trained to make paper. Yet 99% of the time, we don't ever use it. We're stuck in yesterday's workflows.

Especially in government, the typical content publishing workflow goes something like this:

1. Draft content in Microsoft Word
2. Save to shared folder or e-mail around for comments
3. Manually (and opaquely) reconsile changes
4. **Convert to web-friendly format**
5. Publish

My question is this: in a world in which the majority of the time the content is being consumed online, why arent we simply building for the web? Why do we still insist on a print-first worflow?

Think about it this way. Microsoft Word has one purpose: to make paper. You're taught in grade school (or high school or college or work or wherever) to format documents (conveniently displayed as pages) for print. That's the first step in creating something. You open up Word and start typing. There's left align, right align, etc. front and center, but things like hyperlink are burried in sub-menus. It's a workflow designed to make paper, and a workflow align to a specific company. Why would you need a hyperlink if you were just going to hit print?

But the majority of the time the documents we publish are web-first, or never see the physical space. They don't care about page margin, page breaks, or other things that are specific to print. They also don't handle classes, IDs, or othe web-specific features.

Put another way, we're still building content for print, and then once we're done, prepareing it for web. That's broken. In a world in which internet is the primary medium by which content is consumed, shouldn't that be the primary medium for which we prepare content?

And then there's the problem of version control. I can't count the number of times I've been e-mailed a document titled `foo-document_2012_10_15_clean_fixed_revised_final` and told that it "on the share drive" or asked "are you out yet?". What happend with that change I submitted? What updates does this version have? Is this the most recent version? What were the last three changes? Not to mention, I have a crazy idea, can I make a parallel version? Can two people edit it at the same time?

Geeks solved this problem a long time ago. It's called version control. We built it in the 70's. We take content, you edit it, I edit it, we get better content. It's really that simple, and better yet, it's free.

Why doesn't everyone use this "version control"? Because you've got to break free of the proprietary formats. You've got to unprogram how you've been trained. You've got to get out of Word, or Excel, or PDF and start concentrating on pure content. Text. Markdown. YAML.

When you separate design from content, things get a lot easier. Make a change? I can see that down to the letter.
