		"content": "<p>A petition was recently posted on <a href='https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/'>We The People</a> demanding <a href='https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/maximize-public-benefit-federal-technology-sharing-government-developed-software-under-open-source/6n5ZBBwf?utm_source=wh.gov&amp;utm_medium=shorturl&amp;utm_campaign=shorturl'>that federally funded software be released under an open source license</a>. Makes sense. The public should have access to what is technically their property.</p><p>However, <a href='http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120723/12181319800/should-software-created-federal-govt-be-open-source-licensed-public-domain.shtml'>TechDirt posed the question</a> of whether it should be released under an open-source license or public domain, and I&#8217;m afraid they really missed the point.</p><p>There&#8217;s no doubt in my mind that the creator of the petition was simply asking the question &#8220;I can haz source code?&#8221; Plain and simple. Put it in context: 99% of the time when an organization (or an individual) releases software to the public, they do so under the terms of an open source license. It tells users what they can and can&#8217;t do, and tells contributors under what terms they can contribute. It&#8217;s set&#8217;s the ground rules. It&#8217;s a contract with the public. It&#8217;s a prenup for code.</p><p>So what&#8217;s the issue? Although I generally dread the phrase, in this case, government is objectively different. Under 17 U.S.C § 105 US Government Works are not subject to domestic copyright protection. It&#8217;s not technically public domain, but it&#8217;s close enough. <sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> Any US citizen can use the code any way they wish. There&#8217;s simply no copyright, thus no need to license. <sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup> And this entire debate is a moot point if the software is a derivative work of a viral license like the GPL, the most common open source license. <sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup></p><p>That of course, only applies to code created by a US government employee, an increasingly rare occurrence. <sup id='fnref:4'><a href='#fn:4' rel='footnote'>4</a></sup> Absent permission from the contracting officer, the US government retains unlimited rights for all work created under contract (including the right to redistribute). <sup id='fnref:5'><a href='#fn:5' rel='footnote'>5</a></sup> And again a moot point if GPL derivative (and thus must be given to the Government under the GPL.)</p><p>Yet all this is very academic (not to mention dry). Waldo Jaquith and Anil Dash <a href='https://twitter.com/anildash/statuses/227476701599391744'>made a great suggestion</a>: let&#8217;s be pragmatic here. Government doesn&#8217;t hold on to software because they are concerned about licensing. They hold on to software because they have better things to do, because it&#8217;s not within the culture, and because there&#8217;s no angry mob slamming a battering ram against the metaphorical front gates when they don&#8217;t.</p><p>I don&#8217;t think the nuances of federal procurement law is even close to the first thing we should care about here. <sup id='fnref:6'><a href='#fn:6' rel='footnote'>6</a></sup> The concern is about whether feds should do the leg work to open source it or not. The question for us as developers, for the thought leaders in the space, isn&#8217;t how should the US government best license / not license software, but* how can the open source community help it to* * do so.* How can we get more software out the door? In a world of finite time, <em>how can we make open sourcing</em> <sup id='fnref:7'><a href='#fn:7' rel='footnote'>7</a></sup> <em>a bonafide priority</em>?</p><p>How? For one, involvement in existing open source projects <sup id='fnref:8'><a href='#fn:8' rel='footnote'>8</a></sup> would surely send a strong message that there&#8217;s latent demand here, and would give the foot soldiers political air cover to forge onward with their efforts. For another, taking ownership of the code itself, and realizing it is <em>our</em> code, not the government&#8217;s would surely change the tone of the debate by encouraging agencies to ship code sooner, rather than delaying release out of fear of criticism.</p><p>Put simply, it&#8217;s about what role we are going to play, not what rights we are going to receive.

My response? <em>I wouldn&#8217;t.</em></p><p>A dashboard in a car or airplane makes sense. It&#8217;s not as if I could click &#8220;speedometer&#8221; while driving or press the &#8220;altimeter&#8221; button while flying. I simply need everything at all times. But virtual interfaces don&#8217;t have that same limitation. In fact they don&#8217;t have any limitations. A dashboard can have as much information as the most ambitious engineer can dream — and that&#8217;s exactly the problem.</p><p>Put it in context: Google<a href='http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/07/spring-cleaning-in-summer.html'>recently announced the retirement of iGoogle</a>, it&#8217;s own personalized dashboard, and I second their nomination to induct dashboards into the #doingitwrong hall of fame, joining the likes of internet portals, splash pages, and well, basically anything involving ActiveX or Flash.</p><p>Dashboard were a fun user interface experiment. They really were, especially compared to the static pages they evolved from. That was the whole point of Web 2.0, wasn&#8217;t it? Personalization? I mean, it was really cool to drag and drop widgets, and build a virtual command center to monitor my little corner of the internet, and that was fine when there wasn&#8217;t much internet out there to monitor. But the web collectively hit a tipping point a few years back. From push notifications to always-on e-mail, in more ways than we imagine, we now bombard ourselves with more information that we can physically process at any given moment. <a href='http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/retina-display.html'>Quite literally</a>.</p><p>Think about it this way: when customers come to a website, they&#8217;re not looking to solve 10 problems. They&#8217;re looking to solve one. They don&#8217;t want all the potentially relevant information thrown at them all at once; they just want what they need. And they want computers to make that determination for them. But hey, this isn&#8217;t the first time those who predict our user experience needs have erred on the side of <a href='http://www.pocket-lint.com/images/dynamic/NEWS-32125-b3a8b509bc5e3a074f7f240f57d71aa9.jpg'>moar is better</a>.</p><p>So that&#8217;s it? That&#8217;s the end of simultaneous streams? <a href='http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/productivity_apps/240003296'>Far from it</a>. This once-disruptive technology now has a long journey down the Technology S Curve as it becomes the go-to solution for all the business intelligence and project analyst types that stumble across it, in other words, the late adopters.</p><p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I&#8217;m sure guilty of building <a href='http://my.fcc.gov/'>a dashboard</a> or <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Dashboard_Screen'>two</a> in my day. I&#8217;m not saying that they&#8217;ve never had a place. What I&#8217;m saying is that today, not even the most complex dashboard could give you an accurate snapshot of its genus&#8217;s future. If not dashes, then what? Beyond turning everything into a ubiquitous search box (<em>a la</em> <a href='http://gov.uk'>gov.uk</a>), I&#8217;m far from for a UI/UX expert, but I tend to think that startups generally have a pretty good sense of what&#8217;s next. They have to. If they don&#8217;t get it right the first time around, they tend not to have a second try. So what do we see?</p><ul><li><strong>Activity -</strong> Social apps like Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, even GitHub are all built around the concept of activity. Whether its a news feed, recent checkins, or even commit activity, the question I come with is &#8220;what&#8217;s going on?&#8221; and it gets answered as in depth as I care to scroll through, not as in depth as an engineer arbitrarily decided I needed a few years back. It&#8217;s linear. It&#8217;s <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pyramid'>inverted pyramid</a>. It&#8217;s customized by whom or what I follow, not by what I add or (re)arrange.</li></ul><!-- --><ul><li><strong>Minimal</strong> – Productivity apps like Gmail, Google Reader, even dropbox don&#8217;t summarize for me how many e-mails, unread posts, or free MB I have as soon as I log in, and with the exception of a few labs features here or there, don&#8217;t even give me the option to have anything more than a bare-bones inbox, unread feed, or directory listing. In fact, GMail and Google Reader were recently criticized for <a href='http://jonoscript.wordpress.com/2012/04/26/gmail-designer-arrogance-and-the-cult-of-minimalism/'>going a bit too far</a> in this direction. But the lesson is the same: just give me my stuff and get out of the way.</li></ul><!-- --><ul><li><strong>Immediate</strong> - Transactional apps, like Uber or Square focus on action, not the past (or even the present). When I open the Uber or square apps, I&#8217;m immediately presented with the ability to request a vehicle or swipe a card, not my top tasks, not an arbitrary array of options or metrics, not with recent news about the product or popular add-ons. The app simply stands at attention, awaiting orders. I actually had to dig a bit to find my transaction history and related business analytics, and I&#8217;d argue that&#8217;s a really good thing.</li></ul><p>Think about the last time you&#8217;ve used a drag-and-drop dashboard: If you&#8217;re like me, it&#8217;s going to be either Google Analytics or WordPress, and if that&#8217;s the case, it&#8217;s simply known as <em>the screen you see after you log in, but before you can do what you need to do</em>. It&#8217;s wasted pixels. It&#8217;s cruft from a bygone era when clicks were expensive and developers were left wondering &#8220;how can we fit more on a page&#8221;.</p><p>Options are a crutch. It&#8217;s the natural tendency of any engineer to over engineer a system, and that tendency is even stronger in a risk-averse, top-down culture <a href='http://www.google.com/?q=dashboard+site:.gov'>like government</a>. But your job — as an engineer, as a product manager, as user — is to push back, to fight that urge, to make <a href='http://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/'>decisions, not options</a>. Not convinced? That feature you can&#8217;t <a href='https://github.com/blog/1091-spring-cleaning'>bring yourself to cut</a>? Expose it through your API and see how many users complain.</p><p>It&#8217;s no longer a question of &#8220;is this possible technologically?&#8221;. It&#8217;s no longer a matter of &#8220;can you expose me to that information 24/7?&#8221;. Ever since the advent of <a href='http://html5zombo.com/'>Zombo com</a>, the only limit is our imagination. We&#8217;ve figured out the hard stuff. It&#8217;s not centralization and personalization. It&#8217;s decentralization and interoperability. Simplicity is the new black.</p><p><span />: http://ben.balter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/dashboard-all-the-things.jpeg</p>"

		"content": "<p><a href='#note-2020-1' title='The same would apply when you'><img alt='' src='#note-2020-1' /></a> Unsatisfied with your contractor?</p><p>There are two kinds of software: cludgy software and open source. Think about it logically. When you (or your organization) is the only person that&#8217;s ever going to see something, you&#8217;re a lot more likely to &#8220;just make it work.&#8221; After all, who would ever know? <sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup></p><p>But the same logic that applies to sweeping literal dirt under the rug doesn&#8217;t apply to writing code. Whereas a rug will always serve to cover the floor, applications evolve over time and code is often constantly reused and repurposed as customers&#8217; needs change. Simply put, it&#8217;s impossible to predict today where your code is going to be a year from now and it&#8217;s in your best interest to plan accordingly.</p><p>Open source hedges this risk by distinguishing generic logic (say posting content online) from application-specific customization (say the use-case-specific presentation of that content). Yet when you&#8217;re writing with the intention of producing proprietary or one-off code, you do everything in one pass. The true challenge arises when the same problem emerges again in another department, another business unit, or more generally in an even slightly different context. You&#8217;re reinventing the wheel. You&#8217;re &#8220;open sourcing&#8221; (even if within your organization). The solution? Always assume your software is going to be open source, even if you know it&#8217;s never going to be, and here&#8217;s why:</p><p><strong>Flexible from the start</strong> - Imagine you building a house and the contractor literally nails down all your furniture at the onset, saying you could always remove it before you sell. You&#8217;d almost certainly hire a new contractor. Even if you&#8217;re never going to sell the house, you may want to get a new couch, or at the very least change a room&#8217;s layout somewhere down the line. Yet software developers do it all the time. We custom build solutions, and then go back and abstract logic to &#8220;open source&#8221; it as needed. You&#8217;re doubling the effort. Keep logic separate from implementation-specific customization, and you&#8217;ll have a shared, portable solution from day one. Put another way, your business unit is no way special or unique. The same logic that presents updates about the latest line of widgets to your customers can also be used to update the same customer base about cogs and you should prepare for that potential synergy from day one, even if not immediately realized.</p><p><strong>Modular by design</strong>- Distinguishing unrelated components encourages several coding best practices. In addition to introducing a modular design, meaning additional components could easily be added (or existing components removed) down the line, abstraction often yields objectively more stable and more readably maintainable code due to the abhorrence of the copy-and-paste effect. Put another way, you&#8217;re forced to build elegant solutions — the fact that others are not only going to see, but have to be able to use and adapt your code forces you to follow best-practices like name spacing, abstraction, and object oriented programming.</p><p><strong>A message to your future self</strong> – Ever go back and look at old code, <a href='https://twitter.com/BenBalter/status/209356982983999488'>only to scratch your head</a> as to what&#8217;s going on? The same you that may be asking yourself what you were thinking when you got a tattoo five years back, is also going to be asking why you wrote that singleton function five years ago. Yet when you write open source, you mitigate that risk by explaining your code in such a way that others (including your future self) can understand it. In a world of system orientated architectures and ever-changing requirements, the chance that a software project is one-and-done is increasingly rare, not to mention the fact that by failing to properly document, you&#8217;re introducing a significant risk of vendor lock in. Your successor will thank you, and so will the person paying the bills.</p><p>The reality of today&#8217;s business environment is that all software is inherently &#8220;open source&#8221;, even if the scope of the sharing is limited to an organization. Assume the software is open, needs to be modular, and will be repurposed, and you will save significant costs in the long run. And when you require the same of outside contractors, you get better, more flexible code, and offset the risks of vendor or technology lock in in the long run.</p><p>Justice Brandeis is famous for noting that &#8220;sunlight is the best disinfectant.&#8221; Likewise, the transparency afforded by the open-source ethos produces <a href='http://www.coverity.com/library/pdf/coverity-scan-2011-open-source-integrity-report.pdf'>more reliable software</a> – so why not simply assume your code is going to be open source from the start?</p><p>Notes:</p><p><span />: http://ben.balter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/mike-holmes.jpeg</p><div class='footnotes'><hr /><ol><li id='fn:1'><p>The same would apply when you&#8217;re buying software and the contractor is under the impression no one outside the organization will ever see the code, and more importantly, the code could never negatively impact the public&#8217;s perception of their overall work-product <span>5</span></p><a href='#fnref:1' rev='footnote'>&#8617;</a></li></ol></div>"

		"content": "<p><a href='http://www.governmentciomagazine.com'><img alt='' src='http://www.governmentciomagazine.com' /></a>Despite increasing public support (as well as a number of executive mandates) publishing public data in a machine-readable format is not as simple as pressing the &#8220;publish&#8221; button. Why? Equally important as exposing the information itself is fostering a vibrant developer ecosystem around it. By making the publishing agency, not the public, responsible for making information immediately useful, government can lower the barriers associated with consuming its data and introduce additional citizen services at little to no cost to the agency.</p><p><strong>1. Garbage in, garbage out.</strong>Good, clean data may be surprisingly difficult to come by, especially when working with government systems that have been coupled together over decades. Data standards and conventions change, mechanisms of data collection evolve, and the data itself may be interpreted differently as new policies are introduced. As a result consistent practices, like naming conventions or data formats, often go overlooked. Where practical, take steps to normalize the data prior to release, rather than pushing the responsibility off to be inefficiently repeated by each application individually.</p><p><strong>2. Eat your own dog food.</strong>When organizations consume the products they create, they empirically deliver better, more reliable, and more innovative products. You&#8217;d never seek to buy a car from a dealer that&#8217;s never driven one, yet we often expect the public to build applications based on APIs (Application Programming Interfaces – how computers talk to one another) published by organizations that have never had to consume their own data. Rather than solving the same problem twice, start by exposing all relevant data through public APIs and then work backward to build internal applications that rely on those externally facing data feeds.</p><p><strong>3. Data as a citizen service.</strong>It is tempting to try and meet open data benchmarks, at least on face, by publishing snapshots of large datasets. Yet multi-gigabyte database exports do little to encourage external development, especially when such data-dumps are delayed and infrequent. Imagine the usefulness of a Facebook feed that showed your friends&#8217; activity from last month. Datasets should be directly exposed so that the public has access to live, real-time data, either in its entirety, or through proper access controls. This not only allows agencies to deliver more useful information, but also reduces the need to store the same data in multiple formats and in multiple locations.</p><p><strong>4. Curate discrete pieces of data.</strong>APIs are most useful when they do the heavy lifting for those consuming them, especially in terms of sifting through large amounts of data. In practical terms that means returning data to the most discrete level possible, be it a single row, rather than merely returning a subset of the dataset, or even returning a single cell. Seemingly obvious but often overlooked, a query for the broadband speeds at a given address, for example, should return only the data relating to that address, not the entire city or even state-wide dataset. By allowing developers to query the data directly that means they will need less development time on their end, and thus a higher likelihood that an application will be built.</p><p><strong>5. Serve data in multiple formats.</strong>When providing a service, whether you are a waiter or a CIO, &#8220;the customer is always right.&#8221; In the context of APIs, that means you need to return the information in the developers&#8217; native tongue, not the server&#8217;s. For some languages, heavyweight methods like XML may make sense, for others, especially mobile applications, JSON or JSONP may be preferred. Be prepared to return data in multiple formats, even as those formats continue to evolve.</p><p><strong>6. Minimize the handshake learning curve</strong>. Authentication may often be necessary, but the pain associated with it does not have to. Ensure that developers can easily register API keys, with minimal effort and without delay, and rely on common authentication frameworks (e.g., OAuth 2.0) to minimize the learning curve. Similarly, whenever practical, provide common API wrappers and other software development kits in multiple languages.</p><p><strong>7. Encourage adoption through documentation.</strong> Often, the most overlooked aspect of exposing data is documentation. Describe the structure of the data fully, including how to interpret it, and ensure that any technical documentation such as lists of methods and sample code is both complete and accurate. The only thing worse than not having documentation is having wrong documentation. The best APIs even provide Wikis to allow developers to share tools and best practices with one another.</p><p><strong>8. Follow industry standards and convention</strong>. Although APIs may just be beginning to take foothold in government, a set of best practices have quietly evolved in the private sector over the past several years. What may seem like small, technicalities, such as a truly RESTful API or using proper HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, for example, can mean the difference between useful and useless.</p><p><strong>9. Bake in Analytics</strong>. When it comes to garnering support for future efforts, nothing can be more powerful than raw numbers. From the ground up, bake in analytics on both the application level (what applications are querying the API?), and across APIs on the dataset levels (what APIs are being used?). This will help establish data-driven priorities, such as what type of data may be a good candidate for future APIs.</p><p><strong>10. Location, location, location.</strong>With the &#8220;consumerization&#8221; of mobile, datasets are increasingly becoming location based. It&#8217;s not what datasets are out there, but rather, what datasets are out there about my immediate world. Likewise, government datasets are increasingly about where, just as much as it is about what. It&#8217;s important that this reality be taken into account when building APIs by incorporating geospatial lookups within the API, such a relying on MongoDB or other location-aware data structures.</p><p>Exposing data as a service is quickly becoming an industry-standard practice. Many popular startups owe their success to the vibrant app communities that surround them, grown simply by lifting some of the burden off of developers&#8217; shoulders. Government agencies may not yet be able to publish data with the mere click of a button, but when done right from the start, exposing additional data sources may be a more trivial task than many expect, and will in turn deliver value to citizens in ways today unimagined by agencies.</p><p><em>This is an excerpt of an article originally published in the June 2012 issue of <a href='http://www.governmentciomagazine.com'>Government CIO Magazine</a>.</em><strong><a href='http://www.governmentciomagazine.com/2012/06/ten-steps-publishing-government-data-developers-will-actually-use#blog-content'>Continue Reading →</a></strong></p><p><span />: http://ben.balter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/government-cio-magazine-june-2012.png</p>"

These simple words, typed by an open-source developer operating under the pseudonym &#8220;iceeey,&#8221; may represent the first collaborative effort between the federal government and the broader open-source community, and surely represents a tangible win for the open-government movement as a whole.</p><p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is in a unique position. As the youngest federal agency, they have the opportunity to reimagine many day-to-day business processes for an internet era, and to share that innovation across government. One such process is the means by which federal employees apply for and receive subsidies to offset the cost of public transportation to and from work. Having created an application that alleviated the need to shuttle time-consuming, paper-based forms from building to building within their own agency, the Bureau sought to package up the solution, and publicly release the source code for other federal agencies to use and expand upon. The logic was simple: solve the problem once, solve it everywhere.</p><p>But the code was not simply made available for government employees to access. The code was placed on <a href='http://github.com/'>GitHub</a> – a popular source code sharing service – for anyone to download and explore, and within days of CFPB publishing its <a href='http://www.consumerfinance.gov/blog/the-cfpbs-source-code-policy-open-and-shared/'>recently announced Source Code Policy</a>, someone did just that.GitHub user &#8220;iceeey&#8221; <a href='https://github.com/cfpb/transit_subsidy/pull/1'>submitted a proposed change</a> – known in developer parlance as &#8220;forking the project&#8221; and submitting a &#8220;pull request&#8221; — correcting a misspelling on the form initially presented to new employees (&#8220;roundtrip&#8221; was accidentally spelled &#8220;rountrip&#8221;).</p><p>Admittedly a minor change (&#8220;one small step for grammar?&#8221;), but notable for the underlying first that it represents: the opportunity to create efficiencies across government by partnering with the broader community of civically engaged developers.</p><p>Open-source software (software for which the underlying source code is made publicly available) as a vehicle for a more open and more efficient government is nothing new. Behind the scenes, countless agencies rely on open-source software for various business functions, and many have even chosen to publicly publish the source code underlying the applications that they themselves have built in-house to tackle unique challenges. But this seemingly innocuous missing &#8220;d&#8221; and its subsequently submitted fix represents the first time a federal agency has directly collaborated with open-source developers to better its own day-to-day tools.</p><p>Iceeey has <a href='https://github.com/cfpb/transit_subsidy/pull/2'>already submitted his second pull request</a> (&#8220;more typos&#8221; he joked with an emoticon smiley), and I hope more agencies and more open-source developers will follow suit. Such collaborations empower agencies to do more with less; put better, more robust tools in the hands of federal employees as they carry out agency mission; and undoubtedly represent a giant-leap forward for a more open and more efficient government.</p>"

		"content": "<p><img alt='' src='http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/news/PublishingImages/CFPB.jpg' />Most often, when we talk about open source in government, it&#8217;s talked about in one of two ways: either it&#8217;s <a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/11/29/towards-a-more-agile-government/'>the pitfalls of the federal IT procurement model</a> that can&#8217;t seem to comprehend a world in which open-source is an option, much less potentially a superior choice (<a href='http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/09/open-source-government-it-goscon.html'>&#8220;acquisition as a roadblock</a>&#8221;), or it&#8217;s reiterating the same open-source talking points that haven&#8217;t seemed to give open source much parity with the wall of organizational inertia proprietary software seems to have gained over the years (&#8221;<a href='http://benbalter.github.com/open-source-alternatives/'>open source as an alternative</a>&#8221;).</p><p>The <a href='http://cfpb.gov'>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> (CFPB), however, is in a unique position. As the newest kid on the block, it&#8217;s one of the few government agencies to have been born in a digital era, and more importantly, without the bureaucratic baggage that all too often stymies innovation. They have a chance to &#8220;do it right&#8221; from the start… and they&#8217;re doing just that.</p><p><strong>An Agency Born of the Internet Generation</strong></p><p>Yesterday, CFPB <a href='http://www.consumerfinance.gov/developers/sourcecodepolicy/'>announced a bureau-wide preference for open source</a> in its shiny new <a href='http://www.consumerfinance.gov/developers/sourcecodepolicy/'>Source Code Policy</a>, by my <a href='http://www.google.com/search?sugexp=chrome,mod=4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=source+code+policy+site%3A.gov'>crude research</a>, a first for any government agency. There are two watershed shifts here: first, that the agency not only should, but <em>must</em> evaluate open source software on equal footing to its proprietary counterparts, a comparison which I believe will <a href='http://www.amazon.com/The-Wealth-Networks-Production-ebook/dp/B0015GWX0S'>increasingly fall in open source&#8217;s favor</a>, and second, that unless there&#8217;s an overriding security or similar concern <em>not to</em>, public code must be public. There&#8217;s nothing new here. All it says is that we should use the best software for the job (a no-brainier), and that that software, the public&#8217;s property, should belong to the public.</p><p>So why is this news? Plenty of government entities have <a href='http://www.fcc.gov/blog/contributing-code-back-fcc-govs-open-source-feedback-loop'>released</a> <a href='http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/02/11/whitehousegov-releases-second-set-open-source-code'>source</a> <a href='http://open.nasa.gov'>code</a>, or <a href='https://update.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/open-source-procurement-toolkit'>encouraged the</a><a href='http://www.finance.gov.au/e-government/infrastructure/docs/AGuidetoOpenSourceSoftware.pdf'>use of open</a>-<a href='http://www.tekno.dk/pdf/projekter/p03_opensource_paper_english.pdf'>source software</a>. But no one has come out and <a href='https://twitter.com/#!/victorzapanta/status/189390759181557760'>plainly stated that they were an &#8220;open-source agency&#8221;</a>, that open source is the new default, and that absent an affirmative step by some nay-sayer, that the public will have access to their code.That&#8217;s huge. It&#8217;s flipping the burden, and it&#8217;s the way things should be from the start.</p><p><strong>But Where&#8217;s the Beef?</strong></p><p>That said, there&#8217;s one thing the source code policy is noticeably silent on: <em>the ecosystem</em>. Posting code is great and it&#8217;s great that they&#8217;ve done the legal legwork so other agencies can follow suit, but that&#8217;s just the 1.0. The true power of open source comes not from simply publishing code, but from being a member of a broader coding community. Can a CFPB employee contribute a patch to an existing open source project on CFPB time? <sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> What about contributing to a CFPB project once he or she&#8217;s left? What happens to my rights when I fork a <a href='http://github.com/cfpb'>CFPB project on GitHub</a> and send the agency a pull request? <sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup> Can the agency even accept my code legally? <sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup> There&#8217;s a lot of legal ambiguity there, and it&#8217;s just the kind of legal ambiguity a well-intentioned government attorney can seize upon to gum up the very gears that are driving this incredible move.</p><p>We&#8217;ve seen the same progression in the open data world. The 1.0 is posting 10 XML files at a gigabyte each — an arms-length relationship with developers — arguably open data simply for open data&#8217;s sake. The secret sauce lies in the relationship, in publishing APIs and web services rather than static data, to build an ecosystem around the agency&#8217;s work.</p><p><strong>An Innovation Ecosystem</strong></p><p>Imagine if government agencies served as the catalyst for a <a href='http://ben.balter.com/2012/03/05/wordpress-for-government-and-enterprise/#p[NssBlW]'>joint public-private effort to drive tomorrow&#8217;s innovation</a>. We saw this during the space race, and see it today in terms of government-funded research, but by-and-large, open-source coders have yet to be included. Sure we&#8217;ve seen the &#8220;let&#8217;s have some open-source developers build this for us for free&#8221; type challenges, but that&#8217;s about it. There&#8217;s no ecosystem, no community, no push-pull or give-and-take, and I&#8217;m worried that as CFPB&#8217;s efforts federate across government, this nuance may not federate along with it.</p><p>The agency&#8217;s already got <a href='https://github.com/cfpb/transit_subsidy/pull/1'>it&#8217;s first public-generated code contribution</a>, and can expect at least one more on <a href='https://gist.github.com/2343578'>their gist of the policy</a> (Ed. note: does CFPB not <em>own</em> a Blue Book?!), but the possibility of such a relationship with the citizenry doesn&#8217;t seem contemplated by the policy, let alone included as integrally as it should.</p><p>I&#8217;d love to see the next iteration of the policy have a third section, &#8220;III. Membership in the Open-Source Community&#8221; on not just publishing code they&#8217;ve developed in house — don&#8217;t get me wrong, that&#8217;s huge — but actually <em>contributing</em>meaningful code to the broader ecosystem, and working directly with the open-source community to foster an active partnership that delivers the best citizen services possible. It&#8217;s a dialog, not a code dump. There needs to be a conversation there.</p><p><strong>Procure, Publish, Participate.</strong></p><p>It&#8217;s the realization that when you use open-source software, you&#8217;re not a customer. You&#8217;re a member of a community. You&#8217;re invited to a pot-luck dinner. There&#8217;s not the same sense of entitlement you have with proprietary software. It&#8217;s not that they owe you a given feature. There&#8217;s no financial transaction there. It&#8217;s that that feature hasn&#8217;t been developed yet, but can be, the same way every other feature has evolved, through community contributions. There&#8217;s an entirely different philosophy driving the relationship.</p><p>For open source in government to work, it&#8217;s got to move beyond procuring community contributed open-source projects on the one hand, and releasing open-source code developed in house distinctly on the other. It&#8217;s about feeling a sense of belonging. It&#8217;s about the agency taking on a sense of ownership in the broader project. It&#8217;s about participation. <sup id='fnref:4'><a href='#fn:4' rel='footnote'>4</a></sup></p><p>I think CFPB gets it in a big way, and the fact that this is memorialized in writing is a major step in the right direction. They&#8217;ve got the basic mechanics down — procure open–source projects, publish open-source code — but the missing secret sauce that would really drive the policy home? Participate in the open-source community as a matter of policy.</p><p>+1 CFPB, +1. <em>Welcome to the community.</em></p><p>Notes:</p><div class='footnotes'><hr /><ol><li id='fn:1'><p>In simple terms, the core of open-source projects (as distinct from community-contributed plugins or modules) are primarily fueled by &#8220;patches&#8221; (small code change sets) in response to bugs or feature requests, that get committed to the project&#8217;s codebase and released in subsequent versions. <span>24</span></p><a href='#fnref:1' rev='footnote'>&#8617;</a></li><li id='fn:2'><p>If the project is licensed as government work, are my code contributions now government work?

Yet, even among new sites, <sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> the ratio remains somewhat stagnant, if not shrinking, leaving one to believe that the technology has lapped its own already stellar perception.</p><p>When you stack the two side by side (or against any other CMS for that matter), WordPress is objectively the prudent choice. On paper, you&#8217;d be hard-pressed to make the case for anything else. But, it&#8217;s not a technical problem. It&#8217;s a human one. It seems that WordPress&#8217;s greatest asset – ease of use that has resulted in widespread adoption by a largely non-technical user base – is threatening to become its greatest liability.</p><p>Among those empowered to make purchasing decisions, there seems to be a sense that WordPress is what you use on the weekends to post pictures of your lunch while Drupal is what you use for &#8220;serious&#8221; business, and with good reason. For better or for worse, Drupal has positioned itself as not just a CMS, but rather <em>the</em> enterprise solution — an inseparable fifth layer of the increasingly ubiquitous enterprise LAMPD stack.</p><table><thead><tr><th /><th>Drupal</th><th>WordPress</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='text-align: left;'>API Hooks</td><td style='text-align: left;'><a href='http://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/includes--module.inc/group/hooks/8'>267</a></td><td style='text-align: left;'><a href='http://adambrown.info/p/wp_hooks/version/3.2'>1,506</a> (5x)</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align: left;'>Active Sites</td><td style='text-align: left;'><a href='http://drupal.org/project/usage'>533,136</a></td><td style='text-align: left;'><a href='http://en.wordpress.com/stats/'>65,052,049</a> (125x)</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align: left;'>Plugins / Modules</td><td style='text-align: left;'><a href='http://drupal.org/project/modules'>8,536</a></td><td style='text-align: left;'><a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/'>16,076</a> (2x)</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align: left;'>Themes</td><td style='text-align: left;'><a href='http://drupal.org/project/themes'>893</a></td><td style='text-align: left;'><a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/'>1,426</a> (1.5x)</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align: left;'>Community <sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup></td><td style='text-align: left;'>1.5 Million</td><td style='text-align: left;'>20 Million (13x)</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id='beyond_cowboy_coders'><strong>Beyond Cowboy Coders</strong></h2><p>Not surprisingly, the two communities are a reflection of their underlying software&#8217;s position in the broader market.

I am suggestion, however, that there are small, tangible steps that the community can take to make headway into the government and enterprise space and gradually entrench WordPress as a viable alternative to otherwise subpar software harming innocent public servants.</p><h2 id='1_outdated_language'>1. <code>_Deprecate( ‘</code>Outdated Language<code>&#39; )</code></h2><p>The results of the recent WordPress survey suggest that the majority of sites use WordPress <em>as a CMS</em>. That&#8217;s like saying the majority of drivers use their Cadillac <em>as an automobile</em>. WordPress <em>is</em>a CMS. Yet, no one seems to be saying that. WordPress.org calls the software a &#8220;blog tool&#8221;, the WordPress Features codex page <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Features'>describes the site that the software creates as a &#8220;weblog&#8221; no less than 28 times</a>, <sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup> and the first search result for &#8220;WordPress CMS,&#8221; <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lastnode/Wordpress_CMS'>describes &#8220;what aspects of the WordPress… need to be changed in order to turn WordPress into a CMS.&#8221;</a></p><p>Especially in the buttoned-up context of corporate and government installs, &#8220;blog&#8221; can be a dirty word. Yet, to get the title of any site, the command we all still run is <code>get_bloginfo()</code>. Inside <code>&lt;?php</code> tags and out, the technology we have created has far outpaced the metaphor we use to describe it.</p><h2 id='2_make_new_friends'>2. Make New Friends</h2><p>In a typical procurement, be it a federal agency, mid-sized corporation, or local municipality, the CMS does not come first. In fact, many stakeholders wouldn&#8217;t know the site&#8217;s underlying technology if it weren&#8217;t for the logo on the login screen. A firm with a strong reputation in the industry is sought, and based largely on their recommendation, the technology – be it proprietary, open-source, or purpose-built – is chosen by evaluating each across a handful of metrics.</p><p>We all know the decision points. Performance and scaling, handing of complex data types, managing user roles, etc. All challenges that WordPress doesn&#8217;t even flinch at, yet the perception among the uninitiated is still widely that between open-source alternatives, WordPress is the least-accomplished in the bunch. Whether its reaching out and inviting nearby firms to your next meetup, giving a WordPress talk at a non-WordPress conference, or just being an exemplar in your local development community, we need to show the tie-wearing few in the conference room that you don&#8217;t have to be boring, overly complex, or unnecessarily expensive to get the job done right.</p><h2 id='3_but_wait_theres_more'>3. But Wait, There&#8217;s More…</h2><p>WordPress consultants are great at selling themselves, but rarely does anyone ever sell WordPress. Ask my why an agency or municipality should adopt Sharepoint, and I have page after page of <a href='http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/product/benefits/Pages/default.aspx'>focus-group tested material tailored to my industry</a>. Ask my why anyone should use WordPress, and <a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/09/01/why-wordpress/'>I&#8217;m pretty much left to fend for myself</a>. Somewhat counterintuitive in a world of free software, migrating to WordPress comes with significant costs that firms need to take into account, both real and imagined, costs that the technology&#8217;s ambassadors must actively overcome. Beyond actual development and training costs, there are perceived risks of an immature codebase, insecure plugins, and a general inability to do the job.</p><p>One of WordPress&#8217;s greatest strengths is its tight-nit cadre of dedicated enthusiasts. Yet it can often be hard for those on the inside to see things as those outside do. Think about those who have not yet tasted just how sweet the punch is. The name WordPress most often makes its way into a CIO&#8217;s inbox, for example, only when there&#8217;s been a security breach, not when there&#8217;s been a feature release. Where other platforms have stagnated, WordPress&#8217;s &#8220;can-do&#8221; attitude has forged onward introducing even more one-of-a-kind features, yet all too often they go unnoticed or underappreciated where it matters. Both collectively and individually, for WordPress to gain the respect of &#8220;the man,&#8221; we must seek to broadcast its excellence. Now is not the time for humility.</p><h2 id='4_build_serious_features_for_serious_users'>4. Build Serious Features for Serious Users</h2><p><a href='http://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/'>WordPress&#8217;s core philosophy</a> has always been to &#8220;code for the majority&#8221; and with the amount of customization required out-of-the-box to do just about anything, arguably Drupal&#8217;s philosophy has been &#8220;code for yourself.&#8221; While Automattic does a great job with <a href='http://en.wordpress.com/notable-users/'>the CNN&#8217;s and TechCrunch&#8217;s of the world</a>, there&#8217;s a huge opportunity here for developers to fill a void by giving rise to a new generation of core features, plugins, and themes with &#8220;serious&#8221; implementations in mind. Rather than another social media plugin, what&#8217;s the next big thing? Large-scale data? Geolocation? APIs and interoperability?</p><p>NASA&#8217;s space-race supercharching of the aerospace industry brought consumers everything from Super Soakers to sun glasses, and that same reach for the stars philosophy can put yet-unimagined power in the browsers of everyday WordPress users. Distraction free writing and an <em>even</em> more intuitive administrative interface are killer features to be sure, but they are the icing on an already beautiful cake and do little to gain parity with more traditional CMSs let alone take on the CMS space in the &#8220;WordPress Way.&#8221; A good example of this may be <a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/08/29/wp-document-revisions-document-management-version-control-wordpress/' title='WP Document Revisions — Document Management &amp; Version Control for WordPress'>WP Document Revisions</a>, a document management and workflow management tool built almost solely using core functionality. By leveraging WordPress&#8217;s core competencies, the venerable CMS can not only gain a seat at the adult&#8217;s table, but exponentially improve the experience for its primary user base as well</p><h2 id='frenemies'>Frenemies</h2><p>It&#8217;s important to note, though, it&#8217;s not a zero-sum game. Drupal doesn&#8217;t compete with WordPress like McDonalds does with Burger King or Coke with Pepsi. Government support for open-source software is a good thing, regardless of what form it takes. True, an infusion of publicly funded effort into the WordPress code base would invariably advance the software just as government funded research advances hard sciences, but, in the end, everybody wins here.</p><p>WordPress and government just make sense. As public institutions both large and small face growing budget concerns and begin to shift many of their services to the web, a platform like WordPress built with engagement, collaboration, and dialogue is the ideal fit, not to mention, incredibly persuasive when compared to expensive, propriety, or purpose-built alternatives.</p><h2 id='we_all_have_a_stake'><strong>We All Have a Stake</strong></h2><p>Whether WordPress is your primary source of income, a hobby, or just the thing that powers your personal site, we all have a stake in WordPress&#8217;s future. It is paramount that the community stays true to its scrappy roots. After all, there&#8217;s no sense selling the couch to buy a new TV. Yet, in order to be taken seriously by the public sector as a platform for more than simply sharing photos of kitten and chronicling teenage angst, we must first take ourselves seriously, and take baby steps to bring government adoption in line with the WordPress community&#8217;s otherwise unparalleled and well-deserved success.</p><p><a href='http://wpcandy.com/announces/quarterly-issue-one-ships'><img alt='' src='http://wpcandy.com/announces/quarterly-issue-one-ships' /></a> <em>This article originally printed in the <a href='http://wpcandy.com/announces/quarterly-issue-one-ships'>March, 2012 issue of The WPCandy Quarterly</a>.</em></p><p><strong><a href='http://wpcandy.com/quarterly'>Continue Reading →</a></strong><br />(subscription required)</p><p>Notes:</p><p><span />: http://ben.balter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/wordpress-in-government-ben-balter.png</p><div class='footnotes'><hr /><ol><li id='fn:1'><p><strong>Update (3/7):</strong> As many have pointed out, a lot of the misinformation may also be traced back to somewhat of a <em>decision lag</em>.

While eighteen months may be an eternity for the vast majority of the technology sector (the iPad 1 had just barely launched eighteen months ago for comparison), in the Government space, <a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/11/29/towards-a-more-agile-government/'>procurement regulations dictate that such lag times are all but the norm</a>. As a result, in an already risk-averse contracting environment, we may actually be seeing numbers that more accurately reflect say, WordPress 2.9′s reception in the Government sector — a snapshot of when an agency chose a CMS at the onset of a multi-year procurement — rather than those that accurately reflect its technical capabilities today. <span>32</span></p><a href='#fnref:1' rev='footnote'>&#8617;</a></li><li id='fn:2'><p>Jen Lampton, &#8220;Why WordPress is Better than Drupal, Developers Take Note&#8221; (July, 2010) <span>33</span></p><a href='#fnref:2' rev='footnote'>&#8617;</a></li><li id='fn:3'><p><strong>Update (3/8):</strong> The features page is part of a community edited Wiki (the WordPress Codex) and since originally posted, I&#8217;ve gone through and reworked much of the blog-specific language. <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=WordPress_Features&amp;oldid=113531'>View the original</a>. <span>35</span></p><a href='#fnref:3' rev='footnote'>&#8617;</a></li></ol></div>"

		"content": "<p>PHP (and the open-source software it powers) often gets a bad rap in many government and enterprise circles, the brunt of such anecdotal cries as &#8220;it&#8217;s inherently insecure&#8221; or &#8220;X proprietary product is much safer.&#8221; The truth is, much of this unfortunate stereotype is the result of carefully crafted <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt'>fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD)</a>. An established disinformation tactic historically used by big names in software for decades, one of the most notorious instances of FUD being the leaked Microsoft &#8221;<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents'>Halloween Documents</a>&#8221; that outlined the software firm&#8217;s strategy to paint open-source, for example, as more costly or under-supported.</p><p>So is PHP secure? In a word: <strong>yes</strong>. In my mind, PHP&#8217;s ill-deserved reputation can be traced to three key causes (beyond mere proprietary propaganda):</p><ol><li><strong>It was</strong> - More than a decade ago, there was a legitimate argument to be made for PHP being insecure. It used to be that PHP shipped with a poorly thought out setting toggled on by default (that any coder worth their weight in Mountain Dew would toggle off) called <code>register_globals</code>. The setting allowed poorly written code to be short-circuited by passing certain parameters in the URL.  The default was flipped to off in 2000, and removed completely in 2009. End. Of. Story.</li><li><strong>It&#8217;s ubiquitous</strong> - Combine the traffic of Facebook, Wikipedia, and the White House, and you&#8217;ll have a good chunk of the Web&#8217;s traffic, not to mention probably a good chunk of the web&#8217;s attacks as a result. Saying that makes PHP insecure would logically render Microsoft Windows, the target of most viruses, equally insecure and unusable. It&#8217;s just a matter of numbers.</li><li><strong>It&#8217;s Forgiving</strong> – PHP is a very forgiving programming language, meaning it has a very gentle learning curve and is the first web language of choice for many budding developers. Naturally, inexperienced coders learning to code are going to write inexperienced and thus insecure code. Does that mean it&#8217;s insecure? No. Bad code is bad code in any language. Again, it&#8217;s a numbers game.</li></ol><p>It&#8217;s next to impossible to say a given language is &#8220;insecure.&#8221; That&#8217;d be like saying English, as a language, is less trustworthy. It just doesn&#8217;t make sense. In fact, most research supports the idea that the opposite is the case, that <a href='https://www.infoworld.com/d/open-source-software/report-open-source-tops-proprietary-code-in-quality-187169'>open-source produces better quality code than its closed-source counterparts</a>. Think about it <a href='http://www.commlawblog.com/2010/01/articles/unlicensed-operations-and-emer/fcc-changes-stance-on-opensource-security/'>this way</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Someone – let&#8217;s call him Bob – wants to secure a room. But in Bob&#8217;s universe, there are no locks. So Bob invents one, and installs it. And realizes he has a huge advantage over would-be intruders. Only Bob knows how the lock works. So no one else knows how to pick it. Bob sets about keeping his lock design a secret.</p><p>Alice also needs to secure a room, and she also invents a lock. Unlike Bob, though, Alice publishes her design – not the set-up for a particular key, of course, but the details of the overall mechanism.</p><p>Bob thinks Alice is nuts. Why tell people how your lock works? They&#8217;ll just pick it more easily.</p><p>Fine, says Alice, good luck keeping your design a secret. It&#8217;s going to get out, no matter what you do. And frankly, Bob, your lock probably isn&#8217;t all that great. Okay, neither is mine. Not yet. But now that it&#8217;s published, people will suggest improvements. Students will do Ph.D. dissertations on making it better. Companies will compete to develop stronger versions. And long after your design has leaked, and instructions for picking it are all over the Internet, my vastly improved lock will be far more secure. Even though everybody will know how it works.</p></blockquote><p>Put another way, unlike many of its commercial counterparts for which obfuscation is a security staple, open source relies on inherently sound security practices to ensure that whatever you want to remain private, remains private.</p><p>Last, because open-source projects like PHP are almost always monitored 24/7 by the prying eyes of countless developers scattered around the globe, if a vulnerability does arise, <a href='https://twitter.com/#!/nacin/status/9753986051604480'>it&#8217;s often addressed in hours</a>, and you&#8217;re not left waiting days or <a href='http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2008/03/07/delays-in-software-patch-pushed-security-firm-to-disclose-vmware-flaw/'>months as in some commercial products</a> for a patch from on high.</p><p>Is there insecure PHP code out there? No doubt. I&#8217;ve seen it. Does that mean all PHP is insecure? Far from it. Next time someone you know says something to the contrary, subtly mention in passing that you&#8217;re really surprised to hear that the company behind their favorite piece of commercial software recently announced they were sunsetting the project, and see how they handle a taste of their own FUD.</p><p>Notes:</p><ol><li>In simplified terms, if I have the variable $logged_in in my page to store whether a user is logged in or not, and I don&#8217;t first set it to false before checking, a visitor could go to mysite.com?logged_in=true, and the page would erroneously think I was logged in.</li></ol>"

In addition to publishing <a href='http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/02/github/all/1'>their recent story featuring the popular version control site GitHub</a> on Wired.com as they would normally, they also <a href='https://github.com/WiredEnterprise/Lord-of-the-Files'>published it on GitHub itself under a creative commons license</a>, allowing readers to fork and contribute to the story as they saw fit. In <a href='http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/02/github-revisited/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+wired%2Findex+%28Wired%3A+Index+3+%28Top+Stories+2%29%29'>reflecting after the fact</a>, the Wired team said something that stood out to me:</p><blockquote><p>At Wired offices, you hear the question over and over again as we work on stories like the one you&#8217;re reading now: &#8220;Are you out of the story? I want to go in.&#8221; We have a version control problem. We publish Wired.com on WordPress. It&#8217;s a decent publishing tool, but when two people change a story at the same time, one of them doesn&#8217;t get her changes onto the final story.</p><p>We published our GitHub story on GitHub because it was meta-cool. But we also did it to see if GitHub might actually help us solve our problem.</p></blockquote><p>Spoiler alert: it didn&#8217;t. GitHub&#8217;s great for a lot of things, source code chief among them, but it&#8217;s not for the faint of heart. There&#8217;s a great deal of command line, and general geekery involved that raise the barriers to entry just high enough to keep it out of everyday newsrooms and editorial workflows. </p><p><strong>The Pitch:</strong>* What if we could re-imagine WordPress&#8217;s ease-of-use and intuitively dumb-simple workflow to introduce a layer of GitHub&#8217;s collaborative fork-and-merge horsepower under the hood? *</p><p>Users would have the ability to &#8220;clone&#8221; an existing post, make any changes they want, and then merge those change back into the original before publishing.There are four distinct use cases where this feature may come into play:</p><ul><li>Collaborative editing (by resolving two users&#8217; conflicted saves – Wired&#8217;s example)</li><li>Saving draft changes of already-published content</li><li>Scheduling pending changes to already-published content</li><li>Allowing users without edit or publish capabilities to edit and submit changes to content (similar to GitHub&#8217;s pull request system)</li></ul><p>I&#8217;d imagine the workflow would go something like this:</p><ol><li>User without the ability to edit an existing post has changes to make</li><li>User &#8220;forks&#8221; the post, making any change they deem necessary</li><li>When done, user attempts to merge changes back into the original</li><li>Post goes into standard WordPress &#8220;pending review&#8221; workflow</li><li>Editor is presented with diff (using the built-in diff engine), and can automatically accept changes (if there are no conflicts), or manually merge the two if necessary</li><li>Post is re-published with updated content, revision logs merged to reflect history</li></ol><p>In a nutshell:</p><ul><li><p>Extends WordPress&#8217;s existing revision system</p></li><li><p>Clone existing posts, edit, and &#8220;republish&#8221;</p></li><li><p>Schedule changes to posts, including taxonomies and metadata</p></li><li><p>Pending changes diff view, front-end preview of changes</p></li><li><p>Using WordPress&#8217;s pending-review system, integrates with existing plugins for notifications, management, etc.</p></li><li><p>Ability to store &#8220;commit messages&#8221; with each post revision to explain to others what changes were made and why</p></li><li><p>Automatically merges (non-conflicted) changes (based on existing diff engine)</p><ol><li>One sided changes – one overwrites the other</li><li>Two sided non-conflict changes – automatically merge</li><li>Conflicted changes – note conflicts in fork and prepare for re-merge</li></ol></li></ul><p>Post forking may make for a killer plugin  or piece of core functionality… and imagine if it could integrate with other collaboration tools like <a href='http://editflow.org/'>Edit Flow</a>, or <a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/08/29/wp-document-revisions-document-management-version-control-wordpress/'>WP Document Revisions</a>? As in Wired&#8217;s example, it has the potential to fundamentally change newsrooms and other editorial workflows. All of a sudden, any content becomes either publicly or privately collaborative. Pretty cool, huh? While it may be a bit ahead of it&#8217;s time from a human standpoint, from a technical standpoint, the technology&#8217;s there — it&#8217;s nothing new — just a matter of building it, and hopefully solving the dreaded &#8220;are you out yet?&#8221; problem.</p><p>Thoughts? Would you use this? What else would you like to see it do? <a href='http://ben.balter.com/contact/'>Drop me a line</a>, or let me know in the <a href='#comments'>comments below</a>?</p><p><strong>Update (3/5):</strong>The plan right now is to submit this as a <a href='http://ben.balter.com/tag/gsoc/'>Google Summer of Code</a> project, so if all goes well, look for the above-outlined functionality in a WordPress install near you towards the end of the summer. In the mean time, the continued thoughts/feedback is very greatly appreciated.</p><p><strong>Update (3/27):</strong>It looks like <a href='http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/2012/03/16/no-gsoc-2012/'>WordPress isn&#8217;t participating in GSoC this year</a>.

Conclusion</a></li></ul></div><p>Like many government computer systems, the U.S. federal information technology (IT) procurement model is slow, outdated, and long overdue for a reboot. <sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> As the largest single purchaser of code, <sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup> in fiscal year (FY) 2010 the Federal Government spent more than $77.1 billion on IT procurement, and that number is projected to grow higher by the close of 2011. <sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup> This is not a recent trend. Over the past decade, federal IT spending has swelled nearly seventy percent, up from $45.6 billion in 2001, <sup id='fnref:4'><a href='#fn:4' rel='footnote'>4</a></sup> for a total bill of more than $500 billion. <sup id='fnref:5'><a href='#fn:5' rel='footnote'>5</a></sup> This growth is partially a result of the unfortunate fact that as few as nine percent of projects are delivered on budget and on time. <sup id='fnref:6'><a href='#fn:6' rel='footnote'>6</a></sup> The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports that roughly forty-eight percent of all IT projects must be rebaselined, <sup id='fnref:7'><a href='#fn:7' rel='footnote'>7</a></sup> and of those rebaselined projects, fifty-one percent must be rebaselined a second time. <sup id='fnref:8'><a href='#fn:8' rel='footnote'>8</a></sup></p><p>Compounding the problem, end users fail entirely to use nearly forty-five percent of features procured and rarely use another nineteen percent of those features. <sup id='fnref:9'><a href='#fn:9' rel='footnote'>9</a></sup> Thus, purchasing agencies ultimately utilize only about one-third of all features paid for by American tax dollars. <sup id='fnref:10'><a href='#fn:10' rel='footnote'>10</a></sup> In the end, nearly forty-five percent of federally procured software features ultimately fail to meet the user&#8217;s needs. <sup id='fnref:11'><a href='#fn:11' rel='footnote'>11</a></sup> It is therefore no surprise that the Secretary of the Department of Defense (DoD) Robert Gates called federal IT procurement &#8220;baroque.&#8221; <sup id='fnref:12'><a href='#fn:12' rel='footnote'>12</a></sup> Too often IT procurement requirements are crafted with the input of neither end-users nor product developers. <sup id='fnref:13'><a href='#fn:13' rel='footnote'>13</a></sup> As Office of Management Budget (OMB) Director Peter R. Orszag noted, federal IT projects cost more than they should, take longer than they should, and often fail to meet agency needs. <sup id='fnref:14'><a href='#fn:14' rel='footnote'>14</a></sup> Today&#8217;s federal regulations shackle government agencies to outdated project management practices and prevent them from harnessing the true power of IT innovations, which have far outpaced the laws that govern them. <sup id='fnref:15'><a href='#fn:15' rel='footnote'>15</a></sup></p><p>To better embrace innovation and respond to changing organizational needs, the Government must embrace a two-pronged approach involving both regulatory reform and top-down support for best-practices education to empower IT-procuring agencies to pursue more agile software development methods. By requiring that detailed specifications be outlined at the onset of the process, government procurement regulations encourage the less flexible, waterfall development techniques, rather than the more modern, agile development approaches used by the private sector today. <sup id='fnref:16'><a href='#fn:16' rel='footnote'>16</a></sup> While most prior attempts to reform federal IT procurement focused solely on statutory changes, <sup id='fnref:17'><a href='#fn:17' rel='footnote'>17</a></sup> this Note proposes more modern project management practices and argues for top-down reform on both a regulatory and a human level.</p><h2 id='background-waterfall-v-agile'>I. Background — Waterfall v. Agile</h2><p>Two primary schools of thought exist regarding software development practices: waterfall and agile software development. While today&#8217;s contracting regulations may propel agencies to use waterfall development, changes in industry practice with regard to large IT projects demands a government push toward more agile methodologies.</p><h3 id='waterfall-software-development-sees-modern-software-development-as-an-extension-of-its-traditional-engineering-roots'>A. Waterfall Software Development Sees Modern Software Development as an Extension of its Traditional Engineering Roots</h3><p>The traditional approach, &#8220;waterfall&#8221; software development, <sup id='fnref:18'><a href='#fn:18' rel='footnote'>18</a></sup> seeks all requirements and specifications up front, distinguishing design and analysis from construction and development. <sup id='fnref:19'><a href='#fn:19' rel='footnote'>19</a></sup> Waterfall development techniques trace their roots to long-standing engineering fields such as architecture and electrical engineering. <sup id='fnref:20'><a href='#fn:20' rel='footnote'>20</a></sup> In such fields, late changes are costly and rigid requirements are a practical necessity. <sup id='fnref:21'><a href='#fn:21' rel='footnote'>21</a></sup> With the rise of software development in the latter half of the twentieth century, engineers applied the same methodology to developing computer software.</p><p>Despite their similar roots, traditional engineering is not a perfect metaphor for software development. <sup id='fnref:22'><a href='#fn:22' rel='footnote'>22</a></sup> First, unlike traditional engineering fields, software development benefits from nearly negligible switching costs. <sup id='fnref:23'><a href='#fn:23' rel='footnote'>23</a></sup> Second, the bulk of most software development projects is design and system architecture, a process requiring creative and analytical, rather than technical talent. <sup id='fnref:24'><a href='#fn:24' rel='footnote'>24</a></sup> In a world of widely adopted industry conventions, the creative necessities of a large-scale procurement project&#8217;s information architecture often overshadow technical necessities. <sup id='fnref:25'><a href='#fn:25' rel='footnote'>25</a></sup> Third, because software development regularly prioritizes designing ideal workflows and simplifying human interactions rather than embracing a formulaic science, such creative processes cannot easily be planned or predicted. <sup id='fnref:26'><a href='#fn:26' rel='footnote'>26</a></sup> In light of these industry trends, modern software development has recently embraced a more integrated practice known as agile software development. <sup id='fnref:27'><a href='#fn:27' rel='footnote'>27</a></sup></p><h3 id='agile-software-development-mitigates-the-risk-inherent-in-uncertainty-by-approaching-a-project-as-multiple-independent-tasks'>B. Agile Software Development Mitigates the Risk Inherent in Uncertainty by Approaching a Project as Multiple Independent Tasks</h3><p>Agile development adopts an incremental approach to software development, but it does not seek to build software systems in a sequential, step-wise manner. Instead it recognizes the reality that a future system owner may be unable to gather all requirements up front. <sup id='fnref:28'><a href='#fn:28' rel='footnote'>28</a></sup> Even if this were possible, those requirements likely would change over time to reflect shifting technological and organizational priorities. <sup id='fnref:29'><a href='#fn:29' rel='footnote'>29</a></sup> Thus the project is broken down into several smaller components. <sup id='fnref:30'><a href='#fn:30' rel='footnote'>30</a></sup> Plans are continuously inspected and adapted to the empirical reality of the project through rapid prototyping. <sup id='fnref:31'><a href='#fn:31' rel='footnote'>31</a></sup> As a practice widely used in the private sector, empirically agile development delivers better performing projects on time and under budget. <sup id='fnref:32'><a href='#fn:32' rel='footnote'>32</a></sup></p><h3 id='modern-trends-in-both-governance-and-technology-push-federal-procurement-towards-agility'>C. Modern Trends in Both Governance and Technology Push Federal Procurement Towards Agility</h3><p>Today&#8217;s government IT landscape reflects a purposeful march toward privatization. <sup id='fnref:33'><a href='#fn:33' rel='footnote'>33</a></sup> Growing budget deficits in recent decades have rendered the Government anxious to deliver smarter, more cost-effective services to its citizens. <sup id='fnref:34'><a href='#fn:34' rel='footnote'>34</a></sup> In addition to advances in hardware and technology, the Government&#8217;s approach to building complex, national systems has also evolved from the stand-alone computer systems of the 1960s, to the networked stovepipes of the 1970s and 1980s, to the glued-together middleware systems of the 1990s, and finally to the present day disaggregated, service-oriented architecture model. <sup id='fnref:35'><a href='#fn:35' rel='footnote'>35</a></sup> In a setting like today&#8217;s, mission-critical applications are distributed across multiple, loosely-coupled systems that communicate freely with one another, <sup id='fnref:36'><a href='#fn:36' rel='footnote'>36</a></sup> allowing for rapid development and repurposing of investments. <sup id='fnref:37'><a href='#fn:37' rel='footnote'>37</a></sup> Despite advancing industry approaches to large IT projects, by forcing all requirements to be outlined upfront, federal procurement regulations continue to lock agencies into large, single-pass procurements. <sup id='fnref:38'><a href='#fn:38' rel='footnote'>38</a></sup></p><h2 id='despite-its-advantages-and-long-standing-history-the-rigidity-of-traditional-software-development-bears-risks-disproportionate-to-its-returns'>II. Despite its Advantages and Long-Standing History, the Rigidity of Traditional Software Development Bears Risks Disproportionate to its Returns</h2><p>Traditional software development methodologies, commonly known as waterfall software development, are defined primarily by a sequential process <sup id='fnref:39'><a href='#fn:39' rel='footnote'>39</a></sup> consisting primarily of two distinct stages: analysis and coding. <sup id='fnref:40'><a href='#fn:40' rel='footnote'>40</a></sup> The analysis stage, which in some situations can span months or even years, <sup id='fnref:41'><a href='#fn:41' rel='footnote'>41</a></sup> asks prospective system owners to outline all conceivable requirements in a rigidly structured process before formally giving the requirements documentation to a software development team. <sup id='fnref:42'><a href='#fn:42' rel='footnote'>42</a></sup> The development team then completes a prolonged development cycle, fulfilling the specifications the customer described in the requirements documentation. <sup id='fnref:43'><a href='#fn:43' rel='footnote'>43</a></sup> Following this cycle, stakeholders and developers come together (for the first time) to verify that the software meets all initial specifications. <sup id='fnref:44'><a href='#fn:44' rel='footnote'>44</a></sup> These five steps are traditionally understood as the typical waterfall framework completed over the course of the procurement system. <sup id='fnref:45'><a href='#fn:45' rel='footnote'>45</a></sup> While waterfall development provides many advantages in the federal contracting environment, it also introduces many shortcomings both conceptually and practically.</p><h3 id='the-rigidity-of-the-waterfall-process-brings-several-advantages-to-federal-it-procurement'>A. The Rigidity of the Waterfall Process Brings Several Advantages to Federal IT Procurement</h3><p>In both form and function, waterfall development mirrors current procurement models. The first step requires that future system owners document their needs extensively, and such requirements are easily incorporated into a solicitation. This up-front documentation allows agencies to safely budget funds and allows contracting officers (COs) to marry funds to specific, pre-defined contractual events. &#8220;Phase gates&#8221; within the contract provide agencies objective standards to evaluate a project&#8217;s propensity for success and allow agencies to abandon projects in some instances when the prospect of successful delivery appears grim. Within an agency, waterfall development requires COs to justify projects to stakeholders early in the development cycle, and this overall process has gained agencies&#8217; tacit endorsement over the years. <sup id='fnref:46'><a href='#fn:46' rel='footnote'>46</a></sup> By nature of its formal requirements, waterfall software development leaves behind it a wake of documentation, the lifeblood of bureaucracy.</p><h3 id='waterfall-software-development-fails-to-adequately-respond-to-the-ever-changing-conditions-that-make-up-a-project%e2%80%99s-problem-space'>B. Waterfall Software Development Fails to Adequately Respond to the Ever-Changing Conditions that Make Up a Project&#8217;s Problem Space</h3><p>Despite its long-standing history, waterfall software development comes with shortcomings. The outdated methodology assumes requirements can be predicted upfront. As a result it fails to adequately respond to changing conditions and forces agencies to incur costs disproportionate to project returns.</p><h4 id='both-conceptually-and-practically-waterfall-assumes-that-contracting-agencies-can-accurately-forecast-a-project%e2%80%99s-requirements-in-advance'>i. Both conceptually and practically, waterfall assumes that contracting agencies can accurately forecast a project&#8217;s requirements in advance</h4><p>Waterfall relies on two key assumptions: (A) That requirements are fully understood by both contractor and contracting agency, and (B) That requirements are unlikely to change. <sup id='fnref:47'><a href='#fn:47' rel='footnote'>47</a></sup> Yet due to the often-unique nature of government systems, software contractors typically face challenges to which they have never been exposed, rendering predicting of future needs an inherently futile task. <sup id='fnref:48'><a href='#fn:48' rel='footnote'>48</a></sup></p><p>The traditional procurement model, which leans heavily on waterfall&#8217;s central tenants, demands specificity in planning, funding, and acquisition, and requires the contractors and COs to attain a certain level of &#8220;predictive precision&#8221; simply not found in the ever-changing world of technology. <sup id='fnref:49'><a href='#fn:49' rel='footnote'>49</a></sup> As such, by requiring that all specifications be outlined upfront, the current procurement model encourages agencies to attempt an inevitably unsuccessful endeavor and thereby increases project risk. <sup id='fnref:50'><a href='#fn:50' rel='footnote'>50</a></sup></p><p>The unrealistic premises of waterfall procurement create a snowball effect. Because it is impossible for COs to resolve all unknowns at the onset of a procurement, they often err on the side of caution and compound errors by over-documenting requirements and making erroneous assumptions. <sup id='fnref:51'><a href='#fn:51' rel='footnote'>51</a></sup> This risk is further exacerbated as a result of waterfall&#8217;s insistence on delaying testing until late in the development cycle, <sup id='fnref:52'><a href='#fn:52' rel='footnote'>52</a></sup> meaning mistakes often do not become apparent until corrections are cost-prohibitive. <sup id='fnref:53'><a href='#fn:53' rel='footnote'>53</a></sup> Especially given the size of typical government procurements, &#8221;<span>t</span>rying to implement everything at once increases the risk of failure on a grand scale if the technology fails to work as expected or if the original idea was misconceived.&#8221; <sup id='fnref:54'><a href='#fn:54' rel='footnote'>54</a></sup> To function optimally, waterfall methodologies require both contracting parties to possess perfect information. This a practical impossibility when federal agencies acquire major IT systems.</p><h4 id='waterfall-development-fails-to-adequately-respond-to-change'>ii. Waterfall development fails to adequately respond to change</h4><p>A single-pass approach assumes that all variables remain constant throughout the contracting process. <sup id='fnref:55'><a href='#fn:55' rel='footnote'>55</a></sup> Yet experts and lay consumers alike know that technology slowly nudges even the most recent purchases toward obsolescence.

COs and COTRs Require Education Before Agile Can be Introduced to the Federal Contracting Environment</h3><p>Before federal IT procurement can embrace agile methodologies, best-practices education is required on two levels. First, COs must learn best practices for agile contracting. Second, technical officers within the agency must learn best practices for agile project management in the government sector.****</p><h4 id='cos-must-learn-best-practices-in-agile-contracting'>i. COs must learn best-practices in agile contracting</h4><p>Many COs may not know what agile development is, let alone that it is a potential contracting vehicle and how best to implement it. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) should oversee the joint efforts of the General Services Administration (GSA), the White House OMB, <a href='#note-2020-150' title='Strengthening IT program management by exposing best practices and aligning IT procurement with innovation is a central tenet of the White House'>150</a> and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) to educate COs as to agile contracting best practices. <a href='#note-2020-151' title='Ideally instructors would create a scalable model outlining the various issues contracting agencies must broach before pursuing an agile project, such as how to ensure robust competition, how broad or specific the statements of work should be, whether to award to a single vendor or multiple vendors, and when to use fixed-price contracts or rely instead on other contracting vehicles.  See generally Kundra, supra note 13.'>151</a></p><p>Solicitations should outline functional rather than technical requirements <a href='#note-2020-152' title='An example of a functional approach would involve requiring that a system use industry best security practices rather than describing a particular encryption algorithm.'>152</a> and should be crafted without the significant lead time often characteristic of government procurement. The statement of work should specify high-level goals or systems, rather than specific features, and these goals should eventually become the framework that defines each subsequent sprint. The contract should also include specific, functional milestones and accompanying deadlines, which may also be married to an award schedule.</p><h4 id='agency-technical-contacts-cotrs-must-learn-best-practices-in-agile-project-management'>ii. Agency technical contacts (COTRs) must learn best practices in agile project management</h4><p>Alongside existing professional development efforts, contracting organization technical representatives must be trained in best practices for executing and managing development projects through an agile framework. This may include formal workshops for employees; the recruitment of experienced, private sector project managers; or simply a push to increase awareness of agile methodology and educational resources already at agencies&#8217; disposal.</p><h3 id='existing-procurement-requirements-demand-extensive-documentation-up-front-forcing-agencies-into-agile-frameworks'>B. Existing Procurement Requirements Demand Extensive Documentation Up Front, Forcing Agencies into Agile Frameworks</h3><p>Even if an agile-friendly contracts are prepared, executed, and overseen successfully, two statutory stumbling blocks may hinder agile&#8217;s adoption: (i) the solicitation and subsequent award of the contract; and (ii) the governance of the contract while it is in progress. <a href='#note-2020-153' title='This holds true for both the FAR and DoD regulations.  DoD Acquisition Report, supra note 1, at 4.'>153</a></p><h4 id='engineering-services-far-part-36'>i. Engineering services, FAR Part 36</h4><p>The single largest statutory roadblock to agile-friendly contracts is the requirement for technical specifications prior to solicitation. This requirement locks contracting agencies into a waterfall method post-award and is antithetical to agile methodologies. To pursue an agile framework, agencies should establish functional rather than technical benchmarks, developing a framework that can be used to define the focus of each subsequent sprint.</p><p>Part 36 of the FAR provides a modified procedure for procuring architectural and engineering services. <a href='#note-2020-154' title='FAR 36.601.'>154</a> Such a procurement would follow a two-phase procedure. In phase one competing firms would submit proposals including their technical approaches and technical qualifications, but these would not include detailed design information or cost or price information. Agencies would then rank the top firms, which would be asked to submit detailed proposals before the winning firm was selected for a contract to be executed through the design-build framework. <a href='#note-2020-155' title='FAR 36.602-1.'>155</a></p><p>Under FAR 36.601(4)(a)(3), to be eligible for the architecture-engineering route, the acquisition must &#8220;logically or justifiably require performance by registered architects or engineers or their employees.&#8221; <a href='#note-2020-156' title='FAR 36.601(4'>156</a> Congress should expand the definition of this section to include computer and software engineers to allow IT procurement to follow this route.</p><h4 id='modular-contracting-far-part-39'>ii. Modular contracting, FAR Part 39</h4><p>FAR 39.103 allows agencies to break large acquisitions into several smaller acquisition increments. <a href='#note-2020-157' title='FAR 39.103 (implementing the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-106'>157</a> To aid in accounting, budgeting, and documentation, an agile procurement can be contracted as one overarching contract defining the scope of the work and outlining a schedule by which each sprint&#8217;s focus will be defined. This large contract may incorporate smaller contracts for each subsequent sprint, if necessary, as part of a process wholly in line with the Government&#8217;s push toward system-oriented architectures.</p><h3 id='cos-lack-top-down-support-for-it-procurement-reform'>C. COs Lack Top-Down Support for IT Procurement Reform</h3><p>The above goals cannot be realized without significant top-down support from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, OMB, and Chief Technology Officers at each agency. COs must be empowered to take risks with such an unconventional approach. While top administration officials have made statements supporting an agile approach to IT procurement reform, such rhetoric remains noncommittal. Tangible, specific guidance from senior administration officials to agency CIOs and CFOs must occur in order for innovation to succeed.</p><h2 id='conclusion'>VI. Conclusion</h2><p>The federal IT procurement system is outdated. Projects are consistently delivered late, over-budget, and obsolete. Much of this trend can be traced back to flawed legal frameworks that lock agencies and contractors into an outdated development model. Through education, reform, and organization-wide support, federal agility can become a reality. Any computer user knows that as systems age they begin to slow. Today, the federal IT procurement system is running slowly, to the detriment of both agencies and the public, and it is long overdue for a system-wide upgrade.</p><p><a href='http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/'><img alt='Creative Commons License' src='http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/' /></a></p><p><em>Originally published in The Public Contract Law Journal, Volume 41, Issue 1.

		"content": "<p>Never before has it been so vital that the federal government do more with less. On all sides of the National Mall, government agencies are tightening their belts considerably, but the challenge is not simply about trimming budgets or spending less. In many cases, the problem is a matter of spending smarter.</p><h3 id='what_is_agile'>What is Agile?</h3><ul><li>An incremental approach to software development that breaks a project into many independent, fungible tasks;</li><li>Does not seek to build software in a sequential, step-wise manner;</li><li>Recognizes the reality that requirements are unpredictable and change over time; and</li><li>Plans are continuously inspected and adapted through rapid prototyping.</li></ul><p>While the federal IT infrastructure is beginning to show its age — loosing its ability to serve federal employees and thus more broadly the American public — federal approaches to IT procurement and management are increasingly proving themselves to be equally anachronistic. Traditional heavyweight philosophies known most commonly as waterfall development simply move too slowly for today&#8217;s quickly changing federal IT landscape. By the time projects reach completion, all too often, the technology or the customer&#8217;s needs have fundamentally changed, and what is delivered does not resemble what is needed. If we wish to create the efficient government of the 21st century, we must jettison traditional approaches to IT project management and adopt a more agile model.</p><h2 id='technology_that_outpaces_the_laws_that_govern_its_adoption'>Technology that Outpaces the Laws that Govern its Adoption</h2><p>Government contracts are rarely written for agile, and with good reason: As a matter of public policy, procurement regulations force agencies to prefer full and open competition over sound project deliverables. By purposeful design, federal procurement emphasizes the process surrounding the purchase, not on the purchase itself. Traditional contracting vehicles call for stable requirements to be outlined up front and rigidly adhered to, regardless of advancements in technology or changes to the agency&#8217;s needs. Compounding the problem, contracting officers must often secure and commit funding well in advance, rendering adaptation impossible and Agile&#8217;s &#8221;I&#8217;ll know it when I see it&#8221; approach, somewhat counterintuitive. Finally, due to the significant administrative cost presented to the agency, these restrictions encourage agency-wide transformations to be approached in a large, single pass rather than addressing the component parts individually. These procedural necessities — not usually seen in the private sector — generate significant lead times further hindering agencies&#8217; adoption of any approach that relies on small iterations.</p><h3 id='federal_it_procurement_by_the_numbers'>Federal IT Procurement by the Numbers:</h3><ul><li><strong>77.1</strong> – amount in billions the federal government spent on IT in FY2010</li><li><strong>70</strong> – percent increase in federal IT spending over the past decade</li><li><strong>1/3</strong> – procured features actually used by the agencies that contract them</li><li><strong>9</strong> – percentage of federal IT projects delivered on budget and on time</li></ul><p>These potential stumbling blocks, however, do not necessarily prove fatal. Compared to organizational culture, laws are easy to change given enough pressure by those they govern. Ironically, this seemingly technological challenge is, most elementally, a human one. Federal stakeholders must actively rethink the predominant culture in today&#8217;s IT shops. They must seek to train or hire a more agile workforce and rethink the way agencies approach requirements at the time of solicitation. Like any other organizational change, none of this would be possible unless it is communicated as an agency- and government-wide imperative, and ultimately seen to fruition on a project-by-project and task-by-task level by the IT professionals that will be its daily shepherds. Here are five steps that will lead in that direction:</p><h2 id='1_rethinking_an_innovationaverse_culture'>1. Rethinking an innovation-averse culture</h2><p>Government agencies embody an entrenched culture of rigidly defined parameters, documentations, and overall, a meticulously defined hierarchical process. Uncertainty, and thus risk, is mitigated through policy that, by its very nature, resists change at all levels, especially a disruptive change like agile. Before any degree of agility can be injected into a stereotypically form-centric environment, managers must seek to create somewhat of a startup culture within their own business unit.</p><p>At the most basic level, it is not agencies that purchase IT for the government, but rather individuals on behalf of those agencies. Like their private-sector counterparts, care must be taken to ensure that these individuals&#8217; incentives remain in line with those of their employer. Despite this, government budgeting continues to focus primarily on projects that fall within a single budget year, are controlled by a single budget program, and promise an easily predicted, low-risk return.</p><p>For example, contracting officer that adopts an innovative, but ultimately flawed approach may face reprimand or termination when presented with the technology&#8217;s underperformance, while without explicit financial incentives, gains little if the experiment proves beneficial. Put another way, federal employees are encouraged to avoid near-term risk and thus have a disincentive to improve well entrenched but outdated processes like waterfall. New ideas must compete against proven ones, and all-too-often known problems take precedence over potential improvements. High-value, but high-risk ideas like agile require the kind of no-fault support from upper management that only a cultural shift can bring before they can begin to take foothold in the federal workplace.</p><h2 id='2_infusing_agile_knowledge_into_an_otherwise_waterfall_workforce'>2. Infusing agile knowledge into an otherwise waterfall workforce</h2><p>Across the board, federal employees, from contracting officers to in-house IT departments to agency CIOs, many of whom have risen through the ranks of primarily waterfall federal bureaucracies, are often not accustomed to managing an agile project, nor do they often find the necessary encouragement to take on such an endeavor. These federal employees, the front line of agile adoption, must be given the necessary toolset to properly contract and manage agile projects in an otherwise &#8220;over the fence&#8221; culture.</p><p>While many cities, Washington, D.C. especially, may offer agile training and certification, by-and-large federal employees seemingly do not take advantage of such opportunities. Like any industry, federal IT professionals at all levels must make a commitment to stay abreast of significant developments in their field. Project management has undergone a radical transformation in recent years. Whereas once mainframe computers and batch processing rendered change costly and thus an analogy to traditional engineering fields apropos, today cloud computing, commodity hardware, and the adoption of higher-level languages has created a more interactive development process that make mistakes made under an agile framework negligibly cheap. Yet this game-changing inflection point has yet to be fully appreciated by government, despite its widespread adoption in the private sector. Management must seek to infuse agility into the IT workforce either through continued education or strategic hiring at all levels.</p><h2 id='3_focusing_on_functional_rather_than_technical_requirements'>3. Focusing on functional, rather than technical requirements</h2><p>From a practical standpoint, to encourage agile adoption, solicitations and other formal documentation should outline functional, rather than technical requirements. Rather than specifying that a system use a particular encryption algorithm, for example, and thus risk that technology being obsolete or no longer needed at the time of delivery, requirements documentation should outline the functional goal that the agency really is after—in this case, industry-standard security practices. These requirements should be generated without the significant lead-time often seen in government procurement efforts and should involve all relevant stakeholders from the contracting officer to the technical point of contact and future system. An agile contract cannot be written from a waterfall mindset. The statement of work should specify high-level goals or systems (rather than specific features) that will eventually become the framework that defines each subsequent sprint. If necessary, the contract could include specific, functional milestones and accompanying deadlines, which may be married to an award schedule.</p><h2 id='4_making_innovation_an_imperative_at_all_levels'>4. Making innovation an imperative at all levels</h2><p>Like any push for organizational change, none of this can happen without significant, top-down support. First, federal opinion-leaders like the Office of Management and Budget must lean heavily on agencies to adopt more modern software development practices. Without significant political pressure both within an agency and between, reform will remain simply rhetorical. Tangible, specific guidance from the administration to agency CIOs and CFOs is necessary for innovation to overcome existing organizational inertia.</p><p>Second, relevant stakeholders within an agency must be empowered to take risks with, what is by government standards, a radically unconventional approach. Hierarchical status and paper forms—two staples of government—are antithetical to agile&#8217;s reliance on face-to-face informal communication. When responsibility lies in management, and thus is distinct from the actual development activity, such an approach inhibits the fast, authoritative decisions that are the hallmark of agile.</p><h2 id='5_applying_agiletoagile_adoption'>5. Applying agile-to-agile adoption</h2><p>It would be foolish to suggest that a transition to agile can happen on a government-wide or even agency level. Instead, like the processes it espouses, the push for agile should be iterative and rely almost exclusively on successive prototyping across business units. Individual projects, or even segments of individual projects, should be attempted using a fully agile framework, and slowly iterate through the agency&#8217;s efforts as subsequent development efforts learn from the evaluation of past sprints.</p><h2 id='beyond_technology'>Beyond Technology</h2><p>Government agility is not only important in so far as it helps agencies hit increasingly frugal budget targets, but also because when federal projects are not delivered on time and on budget agency objectives suffer. IT programs that cost more than they should or ultimately fail to meet agency needs, means the Department of Education helps fewer students, the Department of Health fosters cures for fewer patients, and the Department of Commerce creates fewer opportunities for the unemployed.</p><p>Technology has lapped the approach the federal government has traditionally taken to managing it. A highly entrenched, management-directed culture fatal to agile has taken foothold in the nation&#8217;s capital, and shows no signs of lessening. Agencies must seek to build a workforce that understands and can embody the virtues of agile in their daily work. Functionality and the agency&#8217;s mission, not technology, should rule the workplace. None of this is possible, however, without significant pressure, both from the administration to agencies, and within agencies themselves, to make the shift to agile not only a priority, but a necessity of survival in today&#8217;s 21st century government. As the public&#8217;s scrutiny turns increasingly toward the federal budget, it is especially important that agencies are smarter about their development efforts and see them not as a line-item expense, but rather as a potential cost-saving innovation.</p><p><em>This article originally published in <a href='http://www.governmentciomagazine.com/'>Government CIO Magazine</a>.</em></p><p><strong><a href='http://www.governmentciomagazine.com/2011/11/federal-agility-adopting-cultural-approach-technical-problem#blog-content'>Continue reading →</a></strong></p>"

The talent you want would be happy to work in an un-air-conditioned garage in New Mexico if it meant the chance to change the world</em>.&#8221;</p><p>Specifically he points out:</p><ul><li><strong>Every element of their work will be pored over by multiple layers of bureaucracy.</strong> Even if that&#8217;s how the rest of the company operates, it can&#8217;t spill into the digital department. In a technology environment, new products and businesses spring up daily and a new endeavor can go from conception to launch in a matter of months. Reining in the momentum will be read as inaction and a clear signal the company isn&#8217;t willing to grasp the new way of the world.</li><li><strong>Mediocre is good enough.</strong> While clocking out at 5 p.m. is attractive to some, it will discourage digital talent. They want to be expected to do something great. They want to be pushed. They care about their work. Their leadership, and those they rely on to get things done, must match their appetite for success.</li><li><strong>Trial and error is condemned.</strong> The freedom to try out new ideas allows employees to take initiative, make decisions, and learn from their mistakes. It also demonstrates an attractive and inspiring entrepreneurial spirit.</li><li><strong>Your company is structured so it takes a lifetime to get to the top, and as such there are no digital experts in company-wide leadership positions.</strong>Digital talent–often in their 20s and 30s–need to see a clear path for uninhibited career development that&#8217;s based on merit, not years spent, and that&#8217;s beyond the confines of the digital department. If they don&#8217;t, they won&#8217;t see a reason to stay with the company in the long term.</li><li><strong>Your offices are cold, impersonal and downright stodgy.</strong> It may sound like it conflicts with the &#8220;you don&#8217;t need to be in Silicon Valley point,&#8221; but appreciate the nuance. A traditional office layout is designed to communicate power among certain individuals and barriers between departments. This does not support the collaborative ethos which is intrinsic to the web. Companies should do everything possible to provide the digital team friendlier, open office space. A location in a hip, young neighborhood (which surely exists in every mid- to large-sized city) is also a big plus.</li></ul><p>I think the argument could be extended to hiring 20-somethings more broadly (<a href='http://www.nextgov.com/nextgov/ng_20100423_7313.php'>I&#8217;m looking at your Federal Government</a>), but a great read, nonetheless.</p><p><span>via <a href='http://www.fastcompany.com/1779120/embargo-1027-why-digital-talent-doesn-t-want-to-work-at-your-company'>Fast Company</a></span></p>"

With more than <a href='http://en.wordpress.com/stats/'>50 million sites globally</a> and eight years of proven history, you know you&#8217;re getting the best software for the job.</li><li><strong>Ease of use</strong> – At the core of WordPress is a <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Screens'>dumb-simple interface</a> similar to the desktop publishing software you use today. With no coding experience or expert knowledge necessary, the learning curve is<a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_Posts'>often about as short as typing in your site&#8217;s URL and logging in</a>. In fact, most users are able to pick up the basics without any training at all. Interfaces are polished and easy to use, and are the result of years of refinement. It&#8217;s the power of a Microsoft Word with the intuitiveness of an iPhone.</li><li><strong>Built for Publishing</strong>- WordPress makes sharing content and attracting readers to your site a breeze. Whether pushing content to social networks, ensuring that your website is provided in the <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Search_Engine_Optimization_for_WordPress'>optimal format to appear at the top of search results</a> the moment you hit publish, or providing visitors the ability to <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Feeds'>subscribe to specific content sub-feeds</a> in their favorite feed reader (or even via e-mail), WordPress is not simply a website, but rather a content-publishing platform.

The latest version of WordPress has been download <a href='http://wordpress.org/download/counter/'>more than five million times</a> since it was release a month ago, and the prior version was downloaded more than 32 million times. With a library of <a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/'>more than 20,000 free, open-source plug-ins and themes</a> growing each day, and hundreds of core contributors each release cycle, the WordPress community is an ecosystem built around the platform&#8217;s viability and proven success.</li></ul><h2 id='content_is_king'>Content Is King</h2><ul><li><strong>Your Entire Workflow</strong> - Although it may sound a bit counter intuitive for some that saw the letters QWERTY together for the first time on an <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Selectric_typewriter'>IMB Selectric</a>, WordPress can actually take the place of your entire workflow from the initial draft to the time you hit publish – spelling, grammar, collaboration, and review – there&#8217;s no need for e-mails back-and-forth or expensive desktop software.</li><li><strong>Beyond Black and White</strong>- Everything that makes webpages feel rich – pictures, videos, music, documents – can feel right at home in WordPress. With a drag-and-drop <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Uploading_Files'>file uploader</a> that uses the latest technology to ensure your file efortlessly makes it to the web page every time, and a <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Media_Add_New_Screen'>media browser to help you store, organize and find the files</a> you&#8217;re looking for, WordPress hosts the files that make your pages pop.</li><li><strong>Distraction Free Writing</strong> - Between E-Mail, IMs, Texts, Tweets, and Status Updates, we have enough distractions as is today. Your publishing platform should not be one of them.

WordPress lets you schedule posts for some time in the future or lets you backdate a post for some time in the past so that you can write when its convenient for you.</li><li><strong>Publish Anywhere</strong> - The internet&#8217;s every, so why shouldn&#8217;t your workflow be? WordPress has <a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/mobile/'>mobile applications</a> for Android, iOS, Blackberry, Nokia, Windows Phone 7, even WebOS.

The site should conform to your content, not the other way around. WordPress comes with a <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes'>full theme system</a> which makes designing everything from the simplest site to the most complicated portal a piece of cake. Have a new design every day. Your ideas should look as good as what they say.</li><li><strong>Obsessively Organized</strong> - It doesn&#8217;t matter how much content you have, if your visitors can&#8217;t find it. WordPress organizes your content by day, by month, by year, by author, by category — any way you can describe it — and dynamically creates browsable archives so things always stay up to date.</li><li><strong>Killer Search Inside and Out</strong>- WordPress has killer search baked in. Every word you write is fully searchable through a single box at the top of each page and if your users choose to use an external search engine like Google, rest assured, WordPress will present your content in a way that all but ensures it makes it to the top of the results every time.</li><li><strong>Even the URLs are Beautiful</strong>- Ever go to a site and look up to the URL bar only to see a string of letter and number gobbledygook? WordPress realizes that websites are built for people, not computers. Every URL is <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks'>intuitively written for humans</a> and describes what your content says, not where it sits in a database.</li><li><strong>Typography Nerds Rejoice</strong> - To do it right, publishing on the web can be a pain without the right tools. Every time you hit publish <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/How_WordPress_Processes_Post_Content'>WordPress silently typesets each and every letter for seamless web production</a>. Where many other CMSs let the details fall by the wayside, WordPress uses the <a href='http://photomatt.net/tools/texturize'>Texturize</a> engine to intelligently converts web-unfriendly characters like quotes, apostrophes, ellipses, em and en dashes, multiplication symbols, and ampersands into typographically correct HTML entities.</li><li><strong>¡Bienvenidos a WordPress!</strong> - WordPress has been translated to more than <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_in_Your_Language'>60 different languages</a>, so however you say &#8220;publish&#8221;, you&#8217;ll be saying it in no time flat.</li><li><strong>Drag and Drop Administration</strong> - Weren&#8217;t a computer science major in college? No degree required, promise. Most of what users see from <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Appearance_Menus_Screen'>menus</a> to the <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Appearance_Widgets_Screen'>dynamic functionality on each page</a> can be fully customized with simple drag-and-drop controls on the back end.</li><li><strong>Multiple Personalities</strong> - Got a bunch of users? Not a problem. WordPress lets you <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities'>define different roles for different users</a> – just like in real life – and lets you assign privileges accordingly. Users can register themselves (if you want), and can submit content for your review.</li></ul><h2 id='user_tested_geek_approved'>User Tested, Geek Approved</h2><ul><li><strong>Out-of-the-box Power</strong> - WordPress provides extensive functionality right out-of-the-box and often little customization is needed to adapt the software for your unique use. Many other CMSs rely on you to hunt down, install, and configure a long-list of add-ons just to get many of the features WordPress considers core (comments, RSS feeds, revisions, etc.) and relies on developers to undertake significant coding efforts to provide the functionality you need. WordPress does the heavy lifting so you don&#8217;t have to. Why reinvent the wheel when you already have the best wheel in the world?</li><li><strong>Open and Transparent</strong>- WordPress is built by a dedicated community of professional developers, academics, and enthusiasts with the source code released to the world to take apart, build upon, and improve. It&#8217;s hallmark is a rapid development cycle, meaning frequent updates and always up-to-date software, all with no licensing fees or direct costs. And with an extensive international community professional support is always wherever you are.</li><li><strong>It&#8217;s Your Data</strong> - Some publishing platforms like to lock you in with proprietary data formats. Not here. WordPress relies on open standards to allow you to take your data with you, and even comes with tools to seamlessly import from many popular sources. It&#8217;s your data, and you should do what you want with it.</li><li><strong>It&#8217;s Your Software</strong> - WordPress is designed to be installed on your own web server, in the cloud, or in a shared hosting account. You have complete control. Unlike commercial software or third-party hosted services, you can be sure of being able to access and modify everything related to your site. You can even install WordPress on your personal computer, or on a corporate intranet.</li><li><strong>Power One Site or Millions</strong> - WordPress offers multi-site technology. It is the same technology that powers over 20 million sites on <a href='http://wordpress.com/'>WordPress</a><a href='http://wordpress.com/'>.</a><a href='http://wordpress.com/'>com</a> and global sites like CNN and the New York Times. Multi-site technology allows users to have full administrative control over their own site, without any security concerns. Each site can have its own look-and-feel (themes), its own functionality (plug-ins), and manage its own users, while at the same time, network-wide policies and security updates can be deployed at the click of a button.</li></ul><h2 id='your_cio_will_love_it'>Your CIO will Love it</h2><ul><li><strong>Your Site is Your Castle</strong>- WordPress has more than eight years of history powering stable, <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening_WordPress'>secure websites</a>. Vulnerabilities are discovered quickly because of the wide user-base and dedicated open-source community, patches are rapidly developed by the dedicated security team, and often released in the span of hours from the time they are reported. WordPress comes with an<a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Updating_WordPress#Automatic_Update'>integrated core-update system</a>, so patches are deployed at the click of a mouse. WordPress<a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Data_Validation'>sanitizes all user input</a>, restricts URL access, has an extensive user permissioning system, and never stores passwords in an unecryptable format. WordPress uses WordPress.com&#8217;s 20 million users to beta test releases before they come out, so that by the time new versions are released, stakeholders can be confident in their stability.</li><li><strong>Extensive APIs</strong> - WordPress&#8217;s core relies on its own<a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API'>extensive API interface</a> (commonly known as <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food'>dogfooding</a>) which consequently allows developers to quickly and effectively customize the application to their unique needs. Many aspects of the essential WordPress experience can be overridden or modified by user-generated <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference'>hooks and filters</a>. These APIs help WordPress integrate seamlessly with existing systems, a necessity in a stove-pipe rich environments.</li><li><strong>Enterprise Ready</strong> - Any challenge the agency faces, chances are, someone else has already tackled it and provided the code free of charge. WordPress has been adapted to countless enterprise environments, and provides support for Active Directory authentication, user management, work-flow integration, and scheduled backups, among other enterprise-centric features.</li><li><strong>Interoperability</strong> - Want to connect WordPress to another system? WordPress uses <a href='http://www.xmlrpc.com/'>XML-RPC</a>, an open XML standard that allows different systems in different environments to talk to one another. XML-RPC is designed to be as simple as possible, while at the same time allowing for complex tasks to be performed.</li><li><strong>Maintenance so simple you&#8217;ll wonder why you did it the other way</strong>- Installing and upgrading WordPress is a piece of cake. WordPress&#8217;s <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress#Famous_5-Minute_Install'>famous five minute install</a> is the envy of the industry, and with <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Dashboard_Updates_Screen'>one click updates</a>, you&#8217;ll know you always be using the best. Try it and you&#8217;ll wonder why all software isn&#8217;t this easy.</li><li><strong>Trust, but Verify</strong> - Not everyone is evil, but keep those who are in check by limiting which html tags are kosher on your weblog. The default html tags allowed by WordPress are a sane choice to let people use html in their comments and posts, without compromising the safety of your data or server.</li><li><strong>Standards Complaint… and then some</strong> - The WordPress team has gone to great lengths to ensure every bit of WordPress generated code is in full compliance with the standards of the <a href='http://w3.org/'>W3C</a>. This is important not only for interoperability with today&#8217;s browser but also for forward compatibility with the tools of the next generation. Your web site is a beautiful thing, and you should demand nothing less.</li><li><strong>More than a Blog… Much, Much More</strong>- Anyone who says WordPress is a mere blogging platform is covering for the fact that they haven&#8217;t been following the CMS&#8217;s explosive growth over the past couple years. Saying WordPress is only a blogging platform is like saying BMW is <a href='http://www.logoblog.org/bmw_logo.php'>only a propeller manufacturer</a>. In fact, the majority of the time, <a href='http://max.limpag.com/article/wordpress-open-source-cms-2011/'>WordPress isn&#8217;t even used as a blog</a>. With built in support for custom post types and custom taxonomies, if you can dream it, WordPress can make it a reality.</li></ul><p><span><span>Creative Commons License</span></span></p>"

To be fair, the business world, and even more so CIO&#8217;s, see avoiding uncertainty and minimizing risk as a core competency, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the whole story.</p><p>The rapid pace of innovation has rendered many stakeholders and decision makers out of the loop when it comes to where a given technology stands in relation to their current practices, and for good reason: disruptive technology poses a risk not only on a organization level, but on a personal level as well.</p><ul><li><strong>From a practical standpoint</strong>, all other things remaining constant, a firm&#8217;s move to the cloud, for example, <a href='http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/news/1381193/IT-job-security-fears-over-cloud-computing-Network-jobs-still-vital'>brings into question the security of the sysadmin</a> that has spent years building up a fiefdom of server farms.</li><li><strong>From a skills standpoint</strong>, there&#8217;s a whole generation out there that grew up on the Internet, and many of those in a position to make purchasing decisions or recommendation are simply not part of it. A young upstart consultant coming in and showing up the veteran can potentially be a recurring (and realistic) <a href='http://www.lexjansen.com/pharmasug/2000/techtech/tt16.pdf'>nightmare for many baby boomers</a>.</li><li><strong>From a professional standpoint</strong>, at its most basic level, risk is taken by individuals (who propose a new system, procedure, etc.), which in many organizations may have an incentive to adopt a &#8220;don&#8217;t rock the boat&#8221; mentality for their own career&#8217;s sake, rather than <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betamax'>risk being wrong</a>.</li></ul><p>If technological innovation were simply a matter of calculated risk and switching costs, one would expect firms to be <em>equally</em> as unlikely to upgrade an existing technology as they would be to switch to a new one. Mathematically, upgrading in-house servers to the next version of Microsoft Exchange may<a href='http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/messaging_value.html'>far outweigh</a> a move to the cloud. Yet, large firms have been <a href='http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2009/07/paving-road-to-apps-adoption-in-large.html'>slow to make the change</a>.</p><p>There&#8217;s a whole world out there of distributed, open innovation that, with the exception of a few startups, <sup id='fnref:5'><a href='#fn:5' rel='footnote'>5</a></sup> has been widely ignored by IT departments, and as Yochai Benkler argues in <em><a href='http://www.amazon.com/Wealth-Networks-Production-Transforms-Markets/dp/0300110561'>The Wealth of Networks</a>,</em> if history suggests anything, it is that the proprietary model is on its way to the endangered species list.</p><p>So what&#8217;s the answer? How can open source fanatics and other early adopters rescue the change averse from their self-perpetuated anachronisms?</p><ul><li><strong>Talk about <em>solutions</em> not technology</strong> – Geeks love shiny new things. It&#8217;s in our DNA. Yet rarely are geeks the one making the decisions. Decision makers could often care less which acronym powers something, but rather than dumb things down (&#8220;this thingy talks to that thingy&#8221;), translate the situation in terms of <a href='http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newPPM_82.htm'>organizational change</a> (&#8220;it will wholly eliminate the need for paper forms&#8221;). Rarely does technology change without the organization following suit. <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Solution-Selling-Creating-Difficult-Markets/dp/0786303158'>Approach the situation as a human problem</a>, not a technical one.</li><li><strong>Move past &#8221;</strong><strong><em>If it ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it&#8221;** – &#8221;<em>It&#8217;s good enough&#8221; should never be a persuasive argument for stagnation.

		"content": "<p><a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-document-revisions/'>WP Document Revisions</a> is a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_management_system'>document management</a> and <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control'>version control</a> plugin. Built for time-sensitive and mission-critical projects, teams can collaboratively edit files of any format — text documents, spreadsheets, images, sheet music… anything — all the while, seamlessly tracking the document&#8217;s progress as it moves through your organization&#8217;s existing workflow.</p><p><strong>WP Document Revisions is three things:</strong></p><ol><li><a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/04/04/when-all-you-have-is-a-pair-of-bolt-cutters/'><img alt='' src='http://ben.balter.com/2011/04/04/when-all-you-have-is-a-pair-of-bolt-cutters/' /></a>A <strong>document management system</strong> (DMS), to track, store, and organize files of any format</li><li>A <strong>collaboration tool</strong> to empower teams to collaboratively draft, edit, and refine documents</li><li>A <strong>file hosting solution</strong> to publish and securely deliver files to a team, to clients, or to the public</li></ol><p><strong>Powerful Collaboration Tools</strong> - <em>With great power does not have to come great complexity.</em> Based on a simple philosophy of putting powerful but intuitive tools in the hands of managers and content creators, WP Document Revisions leverages many of the essential WordPress features that, for more than eight years, have been tested and proven across countless industries — posts, attachments, revisions, taxonomies, authentication, and permalinks — to make collaborating on the creation and publication of documents a natural endeavor. Think of it as an <a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/04/04/when-all-you-have-is-a-pair-of-bolt-cutters/'>open-source and more intuitive version</a> of the popular Microsoft collaboration suite, <a href='http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx'>Sharepoint.</a></p><p><strong>Document History</strong> - At each step of the authoring process, WP Document Revisions gives you an instant snapshot of your team&#8217;s progress and the document&#8217;s history. It even gives you the option to revert back to a previous revision — so don&#8217;t fret if you make a mistake — or receive updates on changes to the document right in your favorite feed reader.</p><p><strong>Access Control</strong> - Each document is given a persistent URL (e.g., yourcompany.com/documents/2011/08/TPS-Report.doc) which can be private (securely delivered only to members of your organization), password protected (available only to those you select such as clients or contractors), or public (published and hosted for the world to see). If you catch a typo and upload a new version, that URL will continue to point to the latest version, regardless of how many changes you make.</p><p><strong>Enterprise Security</strong> - Worried about storing propriety or sensitive information? WP Document Revisions was built from the first line of code with government- and enterprise-grade security in mind. Each file is masked behind an anonymous 128-bit <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5'>MD5 hash</a> as soon as it touches the server, and requests for files are transparently routed through WordPress&#8217;s time-tested URL rewriting, authentication, and permission systems (which can even <a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/active-directory-integration/'>integrate with existing enterprise active directory</a> or <a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-ldap-login/'>LDAP servers</a>). Need more security? WP Document Revisions allows you to store documents in a folder above the <code>htdocs</code> or <code>public_html</code> <a href='http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#documentroot'>web root</a>, further ensuring that only those you authorize have access to your work.</p><p><strong>Customization</strong> - WP Document Revisions recognizes that no two teams are identical, and as a result, molds to your firm&#8217;s needs, not the other way around. Need to track additional information associated with a document? Departments, editors, issues, sections, even arbitrary key-value pairs – whatever you can throw at it, it can handle. Development and customization costs are further minimized by its extensive plugin API, and the <a href='http://themergency.com/generators/wordpress-custom-taxonomy/'>WordPress Custom Taxonomy Generator</a> makes it easy for even the uninitiated to add custom taxonomies to documents. Need an audit trail to track check-ins and check-outs? User-level permissions based on the document&#8217;s state or another custom taxonomy? Support for third-party encryption? Check out the <a href='https://github.com/benbalter/WP-Document-Revisions-Code-Cookbook'>WP Document Revisions Code Cookbook</a> for sample code. Looking for even more advanced control of your workflow? WP Document Revisions will detect the popular workflow plugin <a href='http://editflow.org/'>Edit Flow</a>, if installed, and will automatically pull <a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/10/24/advanced-workflow-management-tools-for-wp-document-revisions/'>Edit Flow&#8217;s advanced workflow management tools</a> into WP Document Revisions. Simply put, virtually every aspect of the plugin&#8217;s functionality from workflow states to user-level permissions can be fully customized to your team&#8217;s unique needs.</p><p><strong>Future Proof</strong> - Switching costs a concern? WP Document Revisions is built with tomorrow&#8217;s uncertainty in mind. Equally at home in an in-house server room as it is in the cloud, moving individual files or entire document repositories in and out of WP Document Revisions is a breeze (history and all). And since the software is open-source, you can easily add tools to automate the process of moving to or integrating with future third-party systems.</p><p><strong>The Vitals:</strong></p><ul><li>Support for any file type (docs, spreadsheets, images, PDFs — anything!)</li><li>Securely stores unlimited revisions of your business&#8217;s essential files</li><li>Provides a full file history in the form of a revision log, accessible via RSS</li><li>Helps you track and organize documents as they move through your organization&#8217;s existing workflow</li><li>Each file gets a permanent, authenticated URL that always points to the latest version</li><li>Each revision gets its own unique url (e.g.,TPS-Report-revision-3.doc) accessible only to those you deem</li><li>Files are intuitively checked out and locked to prevent revisions from colliding</li><li>Toggle documents between public, private, and password protected with a single mouse click</li><li>Runs in-house or in the cloud</li><li>Secure: filenames are hashed on upload and files are only accessible through WordPress&#8217;s proven authentication system</li><li>Can move document upload folder to location outside of web root to further ensure government- and enterprise-grade security</li><li>Documents and Revisions shortcodes, Recently Revised Documents widget</li><li>Multisite and Windows (XAMPP) support</li><li>French and Spanish language support (easily translated to your language)</li><li>Integration with <a href='http://editflow.org/'>Edit Flow</a></li></ul><p><strong>Features Available via the <a href='https://github.com/benbalter/WP-Document-Revisions-Code-Cookbook'>Code Cookbook</a>:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Audit Trail</strong> - creates check in / check out audit trail for all documents</li><li><strong>State Permissions</strong> - allows setting user-level permissions based on a custom taxonomy such as workflow state or other document status</li><li><strong>Third Party Encryption</strong> - example of how to integrate at rest encryption using third-party tools</li><li><strong>Rename Documents</strong> - changes all references to &#8220;Documents&#8221; in the interface to any label of your choosing</li><li><strong>State Change Notification</strong> - how to use document api to allow users to receive notification whenever documents change workflow state</li><li><strong>Bulk Import</strong> - how to batch import a directory (or other list) of files as documents</li><li><strong>Filetype Taxonomy</strong> - Adds support to filter by filetype</li><li><strong>Track Changes</strong> - Auto-generates and appends revision summaries for changes to taxonomies, title, and visibility</li><li><strong>Remove Workflow States</strong> - Completely removes Workflow state taxonomy backend and UI</li><li><strong>Change Tracker</strong> - Auto-generates and appends revision summaries for changes to taxonomies, title, and visibility</li></ul><p><strong>Translations:</strong></p><ul><li>French - <a href='http://omnimaki.com/'>Hubert CAMPAN</a></li><li>Spanish - <a href='http://www.tradiart.com/'>TradiArt</a></li></ul><p><strong>Links</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href='https://github.com/benbalter/WP-Document-Revisions/'>Source Code</a> (GitHub)</li><li><a href='https://github.com/benbalter/WP-Document-Revisions/tree/develop'>Development version</a> (<a href='http://travis-ci.org/#!/benbalter/WP-Document-Revisions'>Build Status</a>)</li><li><a href='https://github.com/benbalter/WP-Document-Revisions-Code-Cookbook'>Code Cookbook</a></li><li><a href='http://translations.benbalter.com/projects/wp-document-revisions/'>Translations</a> (GlotPres)</li><li><a href='http://wordpress.org/tags/wp-document-revisions'>User support forums</a></li><li><a href='https://github.com/benbalter/WP-Document-Revisions/issues'>Submit a bug/feature request</a><a href='http://ben.balter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/wp-document-revisions.png'><br /></a></li></ul><p>Questions?

Not only are they bad for merchants, their business model simply isn&#8217;t sustainable as established firms begin to enter the already-crowded market.</p><p>***<strong><em>Bad for Business</em></strong>***</p><p>It&#8217;s hard for small businesses to profit from the deal. Sure, a daily deal will drive additional bodies through the door, but like many promotions, business often lose money on the deal itself, especially once Groupon or LivingSocial&#8217;s cut is factored in, a cut which can often be as high as 50%. The key, it seems, for small business, is <a href='http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2654788'>to be smart</a>, either upselling the customer, or convincing them that a second, non-discounted visit is well worth their while — not a simple task for the uninitiated.</p><p>Although Groupon&#8217;s compulsory non-disclosure agreement renders the majority of the evidence anecdotal at best, part of the problem seems to stem from a misalignment between the deal sites&#8217; interests and businesses&#8217;, despite what seems like a standard revenue sharing model. Deals are <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/09/groupon-single-worst-decision/'>scheduled to optimize the deal site&#8217;s profit</a>, not the merchant&#8217;s and the unexpected influx of new customers <a href='http://gawker.com/5786492/the-groupon-backlash-its-the-business-model-stupid'>can prove disasterous</a> if not properly managed. For a local business, an injection of constantly-connected 20-somethings can be fatal to the business&#8217;s online reputation if experience does not live up to the deal site&#8217;s <a href='http://gawker.com/5785317/the-groupon-backlash-is-on'>well-crafted hipster-sweatshop hype</a>.</p><p><strong>Legal Pitfalls</strong></p><p>The economics of the situation are only half the threat. Daily deals live in murky legal waters, and the sites often push small business into the deep end, rather than provide the necessary guidance. Basic economies of scale dictate that it would be significantly more efficient for Groupon or LivingSocial to establish a firm policy around the relevant legal issues (<em>e.g.,</em> &#8220;we do not offer discounts on alcohol in Chicago&#8221;), rather than require each small business to incur what most likely amounts to a relatively large expense (not to mention legal risk), effort duplicated across merchants and states.</p><p>As Benjamin Edelman and Paul Kominers <a href='http://www.benedelman.org/voucher-consumer-protection/#liability'>argue</a>:</p><p><span>T</span>he legal and regulatory questions… are questions that arise distinctively in the context of discount vouchers: a merchant would never confront such questions were it not for discount vouchers. Having created the transactions giving rise to this regulatory complexity… discount voucher services should be expected to achieve compliance.</p><p>Edelman and Kominers <a href='http://www.benedelman.org/voucher-consumer-protection/#liability'>continue</a>:</p><p>Voucher services typically seek to cast themselves as mere marketing vendors that are not responsible for the conduct of the corresponding merchants. For example, <a href='http://www.groupon.com/terms'>Groupon&#8217;s Terms of Sale</a> claim that &#8220;The Merchant, not Groupon, is the seller of the Voucher and the goods and services and is solely responsible for redeeming any Voucher you purchase.&#8221;</p><p>…But a voucher service is the merchant of record for the charge to the customer&#8217;s credit card. As the entity officially responsible for charging the consumer, the voucher service thus faces increased responsibility to see that the consumer receives what was promised.</p><p>This, combined with the fact that <a href='http://www.businessinsider.com/teardown-of-the-groupon-merchant-agreement-2011-6'>Groupon claims the entirety of the purchase price as revenue</a> suggests that daily deal sites are the 10,000 lb guerilla unfairly shifting the legal burden to small businesses. Despite all this, Groupon&#8217;s largest shareholder simply <a href='http://blogs.forbes.com/luisakroll/2011/04/04/new-billionaire-eric-lefkofsky-talks-about-groupon-and-tech-investing/'>recommends</a> that business not &#8220;worry about the noise that the legal system creates.&#8221;</p><p><strong>Gift Cards?</strong> First is the question of if a daily deal constitutes a <a href='http://www.ncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid=12474'>gift card</a>, a legal issue with which both <a href='http://www.jpml.uscourts.gov/Panel_Orders/MDL-2238-Initial_Transfer.pdf'>Groupon</a> and <a href='http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Seattle-class-action-LivingSocial-expiration-1015493.php'>LivingSocial</a> are intimately familiar with, defending at least <a href='http://www.benedelman.org/voucher-consumer-protection/#expiration'>12 distinct lawsuits</a>. Despite the expiration date listed online, in print, and often sent in reminder e-mails, in some states, customers may be eligible to redeem deals long after they expire, or at least have ground to reclaim their initial investment, often at the merchants&#8217; expense.</p><p><strong>Sales Tax</strong> Second is the question of what the sales tax should be levied at the time the goods or services are actually tendered. As TechCrunch aptly <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/15/daily-deal-consumer-protection-laws/'>points out</a> there&#8217;s a great deal of leeway depending on how you crunch the numbers:</p><p>What&#8217;s the correct sales tax on a $51 purchase with a $50 Groupon that someone bought for $25 in a state with a 5% tax rate? The possible answers are 5 cents, 68 cents, $1.30 and $2.55. That&#8217;s based on a taxable value of $1 (amount paid at point of sale), $13.50 (amount merchant actually gets), $26 (total amount consumer paid) and $51 (total face value of the transaction).</p><p><strong>Alcohol</strong> Third, daily deals involving alcohol, may <a href='http://www.tabc.state.tx.us/education/pdfs/Happy-Hour-Laws.pdf'>run afoul of the law in certain states</a>. In Illinois, Groupon&#8217;s home state, for example, it is illegal to offer alcohol discounts to some patriots and not others. Researchers found <a href='http://www.benedelman.org/voucher-consumer-protection/beer-chicago-google-060811.png'>87 deals</a> in Chicago alone that advertised discounts on beer, and <a href='http://www.benedelman.org/voucher-consumer-protection/wine-chicago-google-060811.png'>another 252</a> that offered discounts on wine.</p><p><strong>What&#8217;s Next for Groupon</strong></p><p>Not much. Assuming Groupon scales back its cut and guides merchants through the industry&#8217;s legal pitfalls, as Groupon&#8217;s <a href='http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490281/000104746911005613/a2203913zs-1.htm'>recent S-1</a> shows, they are still <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/13/why-groupon-is-poised-for-collapse/'>using the revenue from new deals to pay for previous ones</a>, generally repaying merchants over the course of two months. If Google&#8217;s Offers service gains traction, Groupon could face some serious operating cash flow issues, especially with the competition paying out <a href='http://www.google.com/support/offersbusiness/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1229917'>80% within four days</a>.</p><p><strong>Limited Growth</strong>Daily deal sites&#8217; most successful contribution to the market are not the deals themselves, but rather the hype ecosystem they generate. Like any viral network, their model is dependent on friends continuously asking friends &#8220;oh, have you heard of this cool new thing the kids are doing.&#8221; With the early adopting Facebook generation arguably tapped, it&#8217;s only a matter of time before baby boomers become equally saturated.</p><p>Sure it&#8217;s fun to get an e-mail in your inbox with a &#8220;super-exclusive&#8221; offer, but when everyone&#8217;s in on it, the artificial scarcity is no longer all that alluring. How many nearly identical offers for half off yoga can one person get before they get tired of misses and simply unsubscribe. Multiply that threat by the increasing number of daily deal sites that are springing up and the problem becomes readily apparent.</p><p><strong>Data Blindspot</strong>Smart websites are driven by data — personal data — and they use it to fuel growth. Amazon leverages my buying history to make personalized recommendations and I buy more stuff. Facebook maps out my social graph and recommends people I know and I friend more people. Netflix tracks my viewing history, going so far as to put a up a <a href='http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/21/netflix-awards-1-million-prize-and-starts-a-new-contest/'>$1 million bounty</a> to perfect reading my mind. And daily deal sites know that&#8217;s their <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/11/why-we-invested-in-groupon-the-power-of-data/'>only shot at staying relevant</a>.</p><p>Despite <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/07/groupon-everywhere-jiwire/'>Groupon&#8217;s efforts</a>, there&#8217;s just not enough data there. They may have my age, gender, rough location, and one or two datapoints of buying history, but compare that to the relative dossier that Google and Amazon both have to have on me, it&#8217;s always going to be a losing fight. Once first mover advantage begins to lose its shimmer, the big boys&#8217; synergies will begin to show their <a href='http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/04/facebook-deals/'>true</a> <a href='http://thenextweb.com/us/2011/06/02/amazon-enters-the-daily-deals-space-with-amazonlocal/'>potential</a>, and daily deal sites like Groupon and LivingSocial will expire as quickly as the deals they peddle.</p><p><span>Photo courtesy <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/wovox/5554901181/'>wovox</a></span></p>"

But that&#8217;s half the equation. Web hosting is not simply a cost-benefit analysis of price to uptime and responsiveness. There&#8217;s a third factor there: trust.</p><p>Why does a hosting company require trust? In December, a <a href='http://www.scribd.com/doc/45044630/Koch-Industries-on-Climate-Science'>fake news release</a> was <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/14/business/media/14link.html?_r=1'>published</a> on a Bluehost powered site by an anonymous satirical group, stating that after &#8220;a recent internal and thorough company review,&#8221; Koch Industries, an oil processing company, would be &#8220;restructuring its support of climate change research and advocacy initiatives.&#8221;</p><p>The problem occurred, however, when Bluehost was over eager to comply with Koch&#8217;s subpoena demanding the identity of the anonymous poster, <a href='http://www.necn.com/01/05/11/Koch-Industries-sues-over-bogus-website-/landing_scitech.html?&amp;blockID=3&amp;apID=b76a38541f994e489206850f0db50d02'>arguing</a>, &#8221;<span>w</span>e are not in the business of harboring, you know, felons and crooks. We are not about that. This isn&#8217;t WikiLeaks… <span>w</span>e comply with the law here.&#8221;</p><p>Bluehost knew that the customer wanted to be anonymous (they had opted into Bluehost&#8217;s domain protection program), however, the law here depends on Bluehost providing their client with knowledge of the subpoena, so that a timely objection can be heard by the issuing judge. In the <a href='http://pubcit.typepad.com/clpblog/2011/05/federal-court-dismisses-koch-brothers-trademark-suit-over-climate-change-prank.html'>words of the site&#8217;s own counsel</a>:</p><p>The judge ruled that <span>Bluehost&#8217;s customer,</span> Youth for Climate Truth had a First Amendment right to issue a satirical press release and website – in which the group impersonated Koch and announced that the company had reversed its position on climate change – in an effort to call attention to Koch&#8217;s <a href='http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/campaigns/global-warming-and-energy/polluterwatch/koch-industries/'>notorious bankrolling of efforts to deny climate change</a>.</p><p>The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah rejected all of Koch&#8217;s legal claims, which alleged trademark infringement, unfair competition, cybersquatting, computer hacking and breach of the company website&#8217;s terms of use. The judge also issued an order barring Koch from using any identifying information it had already obtained about our clients via subpoena.</p><p>The problem here arises not from Koch trying to use its legal muscle to silence political satire, but from Bluehost&#8217;s over willingness to comply with a request to identify the anonymous satirist.</p><p>In Bluehost&#8217;s defense, the suit came at the height of the WIkileaks debacle, a time when the industry&#8217;s top names were <a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/01/11/twitter-goes-to-bat-for-wikileaks/'>identifying otherwise anonymous customers</a>, but at the same time, as political interactions move increasingly online, our marketplace of ideas relies increasingly on hosting companies and internet services providers to remain good political citizens (not simply corporate ones).</p><p>While technology may lend voice to otherwise marginalized political groups, it does not come without risk. In a shared hosting environment like Bluehost, &#8220;your&#8221; website, is not necessarily &#8220;your&#8221; website. Will we begin to see subpoena response times along the list of benchmarks and features when evaluating hosting companies? Probably not. But if you are planning on leveraging shared servers — be they Bluehost, Twitter, or YouTube — to blog about anything more than say, <a href='http://dcinterns.blogspot.com/'>DC Summer Interns</a>, perhaps you should take a look at your hosting company&#8217;s legal record before you click submit.</p><p><span />: http://www.flickr.com/photos/timsamoff/391427627/</p>"

From their questions, it quickly became clear to me, that they were missing the point of having a website altogether. <sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup></p><p>Not getting in hot water with <a href='http://www.hulu.com/watch/13576/hot-fuzz-chase'>the fuzz</a> is important, but it is simply one checkbox among many, relegated to the same category of subdued importance as spelling or grammar. The predominant rule in online publishing should not be fair use or copyright, but rather whether the author is adding value to the blogosphere. True, space on the Internet may be relatively cheap, but your reader&#8217;s time is not.</p><p>It seems Internet copyright law has become somewhat of a digital <a href='http://redvsblue.com/archive/episode.php?id=89'>Chupacabra</a> — the subject of endless urban legend and fact-less speculation. Despite <a href='http://www.llrx.com/features/bloggersbeware.htm'>widespread misunderstanding</a>, in practice, both the contours of fair use law and the cultural norms of the net lay clear guidelines for bloggers and content producers. Put another way, <em>the law&#8217;s the easy part</em>. Worry about the content and the law will take care of itself.</p><h3 id='the_culture'>The Culture</h3><p>Much like its roots in academia, the cornerstone of the Internet is the ability to contribute to an ongoing dialog by building on the ideas of others. With few exceptions, if your use of another&#8217;s work does not <em>add value</em>to the discussion, you may be fine legally, but practically, you&#8217;re just wasting space on the Internet. Criticism, commentary, and the synthesis of ideas not only enjoy fair use protections, but more importantly, give visitors a reason to read your content, drives traffic to your site, and justifies its existence. Likewise, facts and ideas are usually fair game, as are promotional materials and logos if you are discussing a specific company or product, but the reason for such an exception is not to give bloggers fodder for an easy blog post, but rather the exception is designed as a stimulus package for the marketplace of ideas.</p><p>The culture of the internet is not that it&#8217;s okay to <em>copy</em> others, but that it&#8217;s okay to <em>criticize</em> others, and if in doing so you quote or reference their work, that&#8217;s considered okay. So if you have something to say, where exactly does the law draw the line? <sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup></p><h3 id='is_it_copyrighted'>Is it copyrighted?</h3><p>If a work is no longer subject to copyright claims (and thus falls in the <a href='http://www.law.duke.edu/cspd/comics/zoomcomic.html'>public domain</a>), the discussion of fair use becomes a moot point. Such a determination does not, strictly speaking turn on the inclusion of the copyright symbol. <sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup> Instead, a work is <a href='http://www.unc.edu/~unclng/public-d.htm'>in the public domain</a> if it was created:</p><ul><li>by the federal government, at any time,</li><li>between 1964-1977 without a copyright notice.</li><li>between 1923-1963 with a copyright notice, if the copyright was not renewed,</li><li>between 1923-1963 without a copyright notice, or</li><li>before 1923.</li></ul><h3 id='is_it_fair_use'>Is it fair use?</h3><p>Even if a work merits copyright protection, it can still be used in many cases. The concept of <em>fair use</em> came about in late 1970′s following the Copyright Act of 1976. <sup id='fnref:4'><a href='#fn:4' rel='footnote'>4</a></sup> Simply put, the Copyright act states, &#8221;<em>purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.</em>&#8221; While there is no cut-and-dry rule as to when use infringes on the author&#8217;s copyright, the determination as to whether a given excerpt constitute fair uses is governed by four-factor <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balancing_test'>balancing test</a>: <sup id='fnref:5'><a href='#fn:5' rel='footnote'>5</a></sup></p><ol><li>the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;</li><li>the nature of the copyrighted work;</li><li>the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and</li><li>the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.</li></ol><p>Some factors that may tip the fair-use scale in an excerpter&#8217;s favor are whether its use was commercial, <sup id='fnref:6'><a href='#fn:6' rel='footnote'>6</a></sup> transformative, <sup id='fnref:7'><a href='#fn:7' rel='footnote'>7</a></sup> or parody, <sup id='fnref:8'><a href='#fn:8' rel='footnote'>8</a></sup> the amount copied, <sup id='fnref:9'><a href='#fn:9' rel='footnote'>9</a></sup> and the effect on the market for the original <sup id='fnref:10'><a href='#fn:10' rel='footnote'>10</a></sup>.</p><p>In short, so long as you link back to the original source, and contribute something to the idea, you&#8217;re probably fine legally, but that misses the point. Don&#8217;t copy and paste an entire post from someplace else, but a few sentences to a few paragraphs are cool <em>if it&#8217;s in the context of you making a point</em>. Just like writing a paper for college, be sure to block quote for paragraphs and use quotation marks for sentences, and cite even if you paraphrase, but it still needs to be about your ideas. The Internet may provide users with free e-mail or free information, but it does not provide bloggers with free copy, nor should it.</p><p>The law aside, readers want you to digest and put ideas in your own voice. Take a paragraph from one post, a paragraph from another, and build a common thread between them – that&#8217;s the bigger hurdle. Give readers a reason to come to your site. Give your site a reason to exist, and nine times out of ten, the law will be on your side.</p><p>[Photo courtesy <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/talllguy/2146845610/'>tallguy</a>]</p><div class='footnotes'><hr /><ol><li id='fn:1'><p>Questions asked included: If there&#8217;s no copyright symbol, is it still copyrighted?; If it&#8217;s posted online, can I just copy it because its it&#8217;s in the public domain?; Can I use it if I&#8217;m not selling it?; and It&#8217;s okay to use if I credit the original author, right?.</p><a href='#fnref:1' rev='footnote'>&#8617;</a></li><li id='fn:2'><p>It should be noted that <a href='http://ben.balter.com/fine-print/'>I&#8217;m not an attorney</a> and my writing should not be substituted for qualified legal advice.</p><a href='#fnref:2' rev='footnote'>&#8617;</a></li><li id='fn:3'><p>This is a common misconception.

I cannot count the number of times that I have used a proprietary or commercial system and silently thought to myself, &#8221;<em>WordPress can do this so much better</em>.&#8221; <sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup></p><p>This ritual saw no deviation, when I sat down to setup <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SharePoint'>SharePoint</a> in support of my <a href='http://pcjl.org'>law journal</a>‘s upcoming publication workflow. Like Alice stumbling down the rabbit hole, it quickly became apparent that in the counterintuitive world of Sharepoint, each step was going to be more and more alien than the last. And then it dawned on me: a corollary of <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfztIIqbTI#t=1m3s'>Uncle Ben&#8217;s law</a>, <em>with great power does not have to come great complexity</em>.</p><p>WordPress does many things right. It is an incredibly versatile tool, but like a body builder with a heart of gold, it is as friendly and approachable as it is powerful. WordPress has <a href='http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk?rev=3'>more than eight years of rock-solid experience</a> storing, organizing, sorting, and searching all sorts of user-generated content. Its got a set of slick attachment functions to allow users to safely and securely upload and store their non-WordPress files in WordPress. For the past three years, it even has a proto-version control system in the form of its much-envied <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Revision_Management'>post revisions</a>. <sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup> And it does all this through an interface so dumb-simple that <a href='http://www.thegrandparentsblog.com/'>even your grandparents could start their own site</a>. It seems like a no brainer then, to marry these tools to create a WordPress-based document management system.</p><p>Imagine a workflow management and version control system <a href='http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2011-March/038727.html'>building on WordPress&#8217;s existing core competencies</a>. By treating documents as a custom post type, users can leverage the power of WordPress&#8217;s extensive attachment, revision, taxonomy, and URL rewriting functionalities. Document permalinks can be routed through the traditional rewrite structure such that the latest revision of a file always remains at a static, authenticated URL, and users can toggle the visibility of documents (both internally and externally) as they currently do with post statuses and permissions. Similarly, file locking can extend WordPress&#8217;s autosave functionality (as a ping), revision logs can extend WordPress&#8217;s existing revision relationship and can be outputted as a traditional RSS feed, etc.</p><p><img alt='' src='http://ben.balter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/wireframe.png' /></p><p>As seen in the above wireframe, document revisions would be inextricably linked to the essential WordPress experience. If you know WordPress, you know document revisions. Why reinvent the wheel when you have the best wheel the world has ever seen, and a passionate global community dedicated to improving it? This approach would not simply be limited to traditional documents. Images, PDFs, code — anything the user wants to collaborate with others on, or have a secure revision history can be thrown at it. Academics, lawyers, government folks, the possibilities are endless.</p><p>To be fair, WordPress has been arguably overextended in some cases, <sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup> but I do not believe that to be the case here. Sure any WordPress enthusiast may be guilty of the <a href='http://xkcd.com/801'>bolt-cutter mentality</a> every now and then, but I believe, if anything, it is enterprise stakeholders&#8217; tendency to gravitate toward bloated, commercial systems that is more akin to Wolf Blitzer&#8217;s boat house, and a big reason why is because with the exception of an unnamed <sup id='fnref:4'><a href='#fn:4' rel='footnote'>4</a></sup> content management system&#8217;s poorly executed attempt at document management, no open-source alternatives exist.</p><p>I am working on submitting this idea as a proposed <a href='http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2011'>Google Summer of Code</a> project, <sup id='fnref:5'><a href='#fn:5' rel='footnote'>5</a></sup> with the goal of giving WordPress parity with commercial and proprietary applications and hopefully injecting some open-source goodness into government and other enterprise environments, but before I do, I would love to hear your thoughts. <a href='http://ben.balter.com/contact/'>Get in touch</a>, or <a href='#comments'>leave a comment below</a>.</p><p><strong>Update (8/29)</strong>: The final result of the project is an <a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/08/29/document-management-version-control-for-wordpress/'>Open Source Document Management and Version Control System</a> for WordPress.

		"content": "<p>I needed a quick-and-easy way to parse Microsoft Word&#8217;s footnote format into a more web-friendly format for a recent project. After a bit of regular expression hacking, I was able to build a WordPress plugin to automatically convert content pasted from Word into a format readable by <a href='http://andrewnacin.com'>Andrew Nacin&#8217;s</a> popular <a href='http://andrewnacin.com/2010/07/24/simple-footnotes-0-3/'>Simple Footnotes</a> plugin.</p><p>The process is surprisingly simple given <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference'>WordPress&#8217;s extensive filter API</a>. First, to grab the footnotes from Word&#8217;s <code>ftnref</code> format:</p><pre><code>//grab all the Word-style footnotes into an array$pattern = &#39;#&amp;lt;a href\=&amp;quot;\#_ftnref([0-9]+)&amp;quot;&amp;gt;\[([0-9]+)\]&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (.*)#&#39;;preg_match_all( $pattern, $content, $footnotes, PREG_SET_ORDER);</code></pre><p>This creates an array (<code>$footnotes</code>) with the both the footnote number and the text of the footnote. We then need a way to replace the in-text reference with the parsed footnotes so that Simple Footnotes can understand them. I did this by creating two arrays, a find array and a replace array with each Word-style footnote reference and its Simple Footnote formatted counterpart:</p><pre><code>//build find and replace arraysforeach ($footnotes as $footnote) {    $find[] = &#39;#&amp;lt;a href\=&amp;quot;\#_ftn&#39;.$footnote[1].&#39;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;\[&#39;.$footnote[1].&#39;\]&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;#&#39;;    $replace[] = &#39;[ref]&#39; . str_replace( array(&amp;quot;\r\n&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;\r&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;), &amp;quot;&amp;quot;, $footnote[3]) . &#39;[/ref]&#39;;}</code></pre><p>Finally, so that the entire replacement can be done in a single pass, push a final find/replace pair into the end of the array, to remove the original footnotes:</p><pre><code>//remove all the original footnotes when done$find[] = &#39;#&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;\s*&amp;lt;a href\=&amp;quot;\#_ftnref([0-9]+)&amp;quot;&amp;gt;\[([0-9]+)\]&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (.*)\s*&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;\s+#&#39;;$replace[] = &#39;&#39;;</code></pre><p>Because PHP&#8217;s <code>preg_replace</code> function can handle arrays, all we have to do is run a single function:</p><pre><code>$content = preg_replace( $find, $replace, $content );</code></pre><p>Putting it all together, including a filter hook to call our function and a <code>meta_value</code> flag to prevent parsing on subsequent saves, the result is:</p><pre><code>/*Plugin Name: Convert FootnotesPlugin URI: http://ben.balter.com/2011/03/20/regular-expression-to-parse-word-style-footnotes/Description: Converts Word Footnotes to Simple Footnotes format.

Today&#8217;s radical transparency (<em>e.g.,</em> lifecasters posting pictures of their lunch) shows we have come a full 180.</li><li>We shift from corporate brand associations in the 50s (<em>e.g.,</em> &#8220;I work for IBM&#8221;) to personal brands today (<em>e.g.,</em> &#8221;I&#8217;m an independent contractor&#8221;).</li><li>Today we all have a unique opportunity to plant a flag on our corner of the internet, take control of our online identity, and declare to the world who we are by crafting a thought-out narrative.</li><li>Unlike in the real world where you are the only one in control of what you say, online, content has a life of its own — you must be proactive.</li><li>WordPress makes it dumb simple to tell the world your story.</li></ul><p><strong>My five big steps to launching your brand:</strong></p><ol><li>Grab a domain</li><li>Define your personal brand</li><li>Start a blog</li><li>Socialize your content</li><li>Upgrade your resume</li></ol><p><strong>Recording of the livestream:</strong></p><p><em><a href='http://www.greglinch.com/'>Greg Linch</a> opens by discussing WordPress and Journalism, I begin at 30m 10s</em></p><p><strong>Accompanying slides if you wish to follow along:</strong></p><p><strong>For those interested in the plugins mentioned:</strong></p><ul><li><a href='http://ben.balter.com/2010/09/12/wordpress-resume-plugin/' title='WordPress Resume Plugin'>Resume Plugin for WordPress</a></li><li><a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/01/11/wordpress-emphasis-plugin/' title='WordPress Emphasis Plugin: Highlight and Permalink Text'>Emphasis Plugin for WordPress</a></li><li><a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/'>All in One SEO</a></li><li><a href='http://yoast.com/wordpress/google-analytics/'>Google Analytics for WordPress</a></li><li><a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-facebook-connect/'>Simple Facebook Connect</a></li><li><a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-twitter-connect/'>Simple Twitter Connect</a></li><li><a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/subscribe-to-comments/'>Subscribe to Comments</a></li><li><a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/syntaxhighlighter/'>Syntax Highlighter Evolved</a></li></ul><p><strong>Additional Resources:</strong></p><ul><li><a href='http://rapportive.com/'>Rapportive</a></li><li><a href='http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2010/10/13/bit-ly-now-lets-you-add-qr-codes-to-links-in-seconds/'>How to generate a QR code</a></li></ul><p>A special thanks to everyone who was able to come out or follow along on the livestream.</p><p>Comments?

In the days before the Superbowl, the agency set out to enforce the &#8220;express written consent of the NFL&#8221; provision attached to most broadcasts by slamming the iron fist of the law down on <a href='http://itwel.com/atdhe-live-sports-streaming-website-seized-by-us-authorities.php'>six sports-streaming websites</a>. This is troubling on multiple levels. As the Vololkh Conspiracy&#8217;s David Post <a href='http://volokh.com/2011/02/02/more-outrageous-domain-name-seizures-by-our-vigilant-dept-of-homeland-security/'>put it</a>:</p><blockquote><p>There&#8217;s a good reason we don&#8217;t generally allow agents of the State to march into judge&#8217;s chambers and deprive people of their property without an adversary hearing, viz., they&#8217;re likely to make errors that can be difficult to correct ex post.</p></blockquote><p>And that&#8217;s exactly what happened when the Feds <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/02/rojadirecta-org-seized_n_817458.html'>seized riojadirecta.org</a>.However, the law in the area is a bit more nuanced than a single form can satisfy. Riojadirecta did not actually host any infringing content — it merely aggregated links to such content — potentially invoking the safe harbor provisions of the copyright act. <sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> Compounding the issue, Spanish Courts had found the Spanish-based site to be <a href='http://torrentfreak.com/sports-streaming-torrent-links-site-victorious-in-court-100510/'>perfectly legal</a>, just a few months prior.</p><p>Seizures of this type are nothing new. Back in November, DHS <a href='http://torrentfreak.com/u-s-government-seizes-bittorrent-search-engine-domain-and-more-101126/'>commandeered</a> some <a href='http://www.ice.gov/doclib/news/releases/2010/domain_names.pdf'>80 bit torrent domains</a> (PDF) as part of the broader &#8221;<a href='http://www.ice.gov/news/releases/1006/100630losangeles.htm'>Operation In Our Sites</a>&#8221;. One such site, dajaz1.com, a music blog dedicated to hip-hop, was claimed to have infringed on music copyrights, however it was later revealed that the <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/20/business/media/20music.html?_r=1&amp;ref=todayspaper'>music in question was provided to the site by music industry executives</a>. Despite this revelation, DHS made no apparent move to look into the case or restore the domain, and <a href='http://dajaz1.com/'>the site remains down</a> to this day.</p><p>Part of the problem may stem from law enforcement being out of touch with today&#8217;s trends. Even the agent in charge of the investigation <a href='http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/12/busting-bittorrent.ars'>referred to the infringing material as &#8220;a bit torrent,&#8221;</a> suggesting a sophomoric understand of just what exactly was being seized.</p><p>More worrisome, however, is the fact that the statute cited to authorize such seizures, 18 U.S.C. § 2323, provides no safeguard to prevent such errors from occurring <sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup> nor does it <a href='http://www.copyhype.com/2011/02/can-google-be-seized-by-ice/'>prohibit its expanded use</a>. <sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup> As Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) <a href='http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/02/senator-us-domain-name-seizures-alarmingly-unprecedented.ars?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss'>argued</a>:</p><blockquote><p>In contrast to ordinary copyright litigation, the domain name seizure process does not appear to give targeted websites an opportunity to defend themselves before sanctions are imposed… I worry that domain name seizures could function as a means for end-running the normal legal process in order to target websites that may prevail in full court. The new enforcement approach used by Operation In Our Sites is alarmingly unprecedented in the breadth of its potential reach.</p></blockquote><p>Even looking beyond the due process issues and to the underlying copyright infringement, simply put, the government&#8217;s efforts fail to solve the problem. In Riojadirecta&#8217;s case, for example, the site <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/rojadirecta/status/32348722188779520'>used Twitter</a> to <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/02/rojadirecta-org-seized_n_817458.html'>direct users to one of its five other domains</a> rending the seizure a moot point. The problem is that the government is not seizing the infringing material, but rather, an <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name'>alias for the network address</a> of a site that in many cases, only contains links to infringing material. It would be as if DHS seized my cell phone number because my friends could use it to call and find out the location of a weekly poker game — the game would still take place, I would just get a new phone number.</p><p>The most upsetting part, at least for the web developer in me, has to be <a href='http://dajaz1.com/IPRC_Seized_2010_11.gif'>the seizure notice</a> itself. Putting text in images like that has to be up there with <a href='http://bancomicsans.com/'>using Comic Sans</a>. While I do not expect DHS to hire a legion of designers and developers to make an HTML5 seizure notice (although that would be awesome), some in-document text would go a long way to making the web a whole lot less ugly. <sup id='fnref:4'><a href='#fn:4' rel='footnote'>4</a></sup> Additionally, it looks like their policy has changed since the initial seizures, however, at least as late as November, DHS was <a href='http://qbit.cc/homeland-security-tracking-visits-to-seized-domains-using-google-analytics-and-piwik/'>placing Google Analytics and Piwik tracking codes on its seized domains</a>, arguably in violation of <a href='http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/memoranda_2010/m10-22.pdf'>OMB memorandum M-10-22</a> (PDF).</p><p>As seen in the recent <a href='http://gawker.com/#!5704966/wikileaks-loses-its-domain'>Wikileaks domain shell game</a>, its clear that domain servers are the weak link in the online content-delivery chain. When the state can no longer seize something that represent the forefront of our ability to communicate with one another (decentralized information sharing) and replace it with a technology the web collectively deprecated with the rise of CSS1 (sites which rely on .GIFs to render text), legality and politics aside, the internet will undoubtedly be a better place.</p><p>Notes:</p><div class='footnotes'><hr /><ol><li id='fn:1'><p>17 U.S.C. § 512(d). <span>25</span></p><a href='#fnref:1' rev='footnote'>&#8617;</a></li><li id='fn:2'><p>The relevant provisions of § 2323 allow for the forfeiture of &#8220;(A) Any article, the making or trafficking of which is, prohibited under section 506 of title 17″ prohibiting &#8220;willful copyright infringement&#8221; and &#8220;(B) Any property used, or intended to be used, in any manner or part to commit or facilitate the commission of an offense referred to in subparagraph (A).&#8221; <span>26</span></p><a href='#fnref:2' rev='footnote'>&#8617;</a></li><li id='fn:3'><p>As <a href='http://volokh.com/2010/12/01/copyright-enforcement-tail-wags-internet-dog-contd-or-what-the-hell-ever-happened-to-due-process/'>Post noted back then</a>, and even more relevant now in light of Egypt&#8217;s recent flipping of its internet kill switch, &#8220;our ability to defend the principle of the single global Internet – the Internet where all of humanity has equal access to knowledge and ideas, the Internet that looks the same to, and allows free and unfettered communication between, users located in Shanghai and Seattle and Santiago, free of locally imposed censorship regimes – will be deeply compromised by <span>seizures of this kind</span>, which would enshrine in U.S. law for the first time the contrary principle: that all countries have a right to insist on the removal of content, wherever located, from the global Internet in service of the exigencies of local law.&#8221; (Quoting a <a href='http://volokh.com/2010/12/01/copyright-enforcement-tail-wags-internet-dog-contd-or-what-the-hell-ever-happened-to-due-process/'>letter he authored</a> criticizing the Senate&#8217;s Combating Online Infringements and Counterfeits Act). <span>28</span></p><a href='#fnref:3' rev='footnote'>&#8617;</a></li><li id='fn:4'><p>Beyond being reminiscent of Geocities (and most of the 90s), text in images is not machine readable, a requirement of section 508 (codified at 29 U.S.C. § 794(d)) .

The growing popularity of the cloud coupled with increasing power of smart phones has resulted in what not too long ago was tool for placing and receiving calls, today, in actuality, is a portal to one&#8217;s entire digital life. Imagine if a routine traffic stop, say, for failing to signal properly, would place in the state&#8217;s hands every e-mail you have ever sent, contact you have ever met, or financial transaction you have ever completed (not to mention your current <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angry_Birds'>Angry Birds</a> score!). Regardless of how Orwellian it may sound, the California Supreme Court <a href='http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/01/warrantless-cell-phone-search-gets-a-green-light-in-california.ars?comments=1#comments-bar'>ruled in favor of just such an outcome</a>.</p><p>In <em><a href='http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S166600.PDF'>People v. Diaz</a></em>, the court ruled that a warrentless search of text messages on a cell phone confiscated subsequent to a lawful arrest did infact, constitute a valid search. While the dissent realized that mobile phones were increasingly becoming the hubs of our digital world, noting that the decision gave &#8221;<em>carte blanche, with no showing of exigency, to rummage at leisure through the wealth of personal and business information that can be carried on a mobile phone or handheld computer merely because the device was taken from an arrestee&#8217;s person,</em>&#8221; I do not believe they fully grasped the gravity of the ruling. <sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup></p><p><img alt='' src='http://cdn.benbalter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/zoolander-300x188.jpg' /><a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_PncKuDao&amp;feature=related#t=1m16s'>Much like Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson&#8217;s characters in the movie Zoolander</a>, the dissent&#8217;s analysis is based on the assumption that information &#8220;can be carried on&#8221; or &#8220;in&#8221; one&#8217;s mobile phone, a reality which simply is not the case in today&#8217;s increasingly cloud-centric world.</p><p>Today, and even more so tomorrow, information will not be &#8220;carried on&#8221; a phone, but rather, that phone will merely be the vehicle used to access information stored elsewhere, information that would otherwise carry the highest expectation of privacy. Put another way, the device holds, both literally and metaphorically, the address, keys, and means to access one&#8217;s digital home, a breach of privacy that would not be tolerated if it occurred in a more tangible sense.</p><p>In a world where in reality, nearly every e-mail I have ever sent or received can be accessed by opening a folder on my phone virtually indistinguishable <sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup> from any neighboring folder that contains locally stored information, the majority&#8217;s interpretation grants the state access to nearly everything one says or does on a daily basis. Put another way, how much information do you think <em>won&#8217;t</em> be accessible from your mobile phone in 5 years? 10 years? 20? Just scroll through your home screen. <sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup></p><p>The majority&#8217;s decision was well argued by legal minds much wiser than my own, but even reading through the verbiage of the opinion, discussing the nature of containers and cavities as they relate to what is &#8220;in&#8221; the phone, it leads one to believe that their analysis is handicapped by <a href='http://movieclips.com/sgNVB-zoolander-movie-computer-experts/'>outdated concepts of storage and space</a>. <sup id='fnref:4'><a href='#fn:4' rel='footnote'>4</a></sup></p><p>While it may not be practical to install <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage'>Faraday cages</a> in every police station to ferret out what information can be gleamed from a mobile device without it querying a remote server (if there is any information at all), the majority&#8217;s opinion fails to take into account the reality of how mobile phones are used today, let alone, how they will be most likely be used in the not-to-distant future.

The Sixth Circuit wrote:</p><blockquote><p>&#8221;<span>T</span>he ISP is the functional equivalent of a post office or a telephone company… <span>T</span>he police may not storm the post office and intercept a letter, and they are likewise forbidden from using the phone system to make a clandestine recording of a telephone call—unless they get a warrant, that is.&#8221; <sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>&lt;/span&gt;</p></blockquote><p>Prior to the ruling, the government could (<a href='http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/governmentrequests/'>and regularly did</a>) obtain e-mails stored on third-party hosts like Gmail, without first needing to obtain a search warrant. In its decision, the district court declared the 1986 Stored Communications Act (SCA) <a href='#note-2020-2' title='18 U.S.C. 2703(b'>2</a> unconstitutional on the grounds that it allowed what was tantamount to a traditional search, but without the required showing of probable cause.

After all, during peak hours, just 2% of Netflix users (via Level 3) account for <a href='http://www.slate.com/id/2273314/'>20% of all bandwidth used</a> in North America. In Comcast&#8217;s own words:</p><blockquote><p><span>W</span>hen one provider… push<span>es</span> the burden of massive traffic growth onto the other provider and its customers, we believe this is not fair.</p></blockquote><p>The problem with the &#8220;it&#8217;s the customer&#8217;s fault for using our service&#8221; argument, the <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/03/technology/companies/03att.html?_r=1'>same argument used by AT&amp;T</a> not too long ago, is that, if they haven&#8217;t already, service providers need to realize the Internet is here to stay. We as consumers like browsing the net. We like images. We like YouTube videos. We like interactive content. We like streaming stuff, and tomorrow we may like holograms or virtual reality or whatever the next cool, shiny thing is. Consumers simply can&#8217;t get enough rich, bandwidth-intensive content, and if you&#8217;re an internet service provider, you can&#8217;t complain when your customers use your service to do just that.</p><p>True, this may simply be <a href='http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/03/isp-quarrel-par/'>another petty dispute</a> between service providers as <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/ceciliakang/statuses/9730130310078464'>Comcast claims</a>, but the bigger problem with Comcast&#8217;s decision, however, is that Comcast is not simply a <em>service</em> provider (tubes), but with the <a href='http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/netflix-partner-says-comcast-toll-threatens-online-video-delivery/'>impending NBC merger</a>, also a <em>content</em> provider (the stuff in those tubes). This decision marks this first practical case where a service provider is actually taking steps to single out and discriminate against their competitor&#8217;s content. As Level 3′s Chief Legal Officer <a href='http://www.marketwatch.com/story/level-3-communications-issues-statement-concerning-comcasts-actions-2010-11-29?reflink=MW_news_stmp'>put it</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Comcast is putting up a tollbooth at the borders of its broadband internet-access network, enabling it to unilaterally decide how much to charge for content which competes with its own cable TV and Xfinity-delivered content.</p></blockquote><p>The Level-3/Comcast arrangement spells bleak hope for any future in which the Internet&#8217;s information democratization ethos continues – perhaps a commercialized future <a href='http://io9.com/5610328/how-the-googleverizon-proposal-could-kill-the-internet-in-5-years'>not too dissimilar from today&#8217;s tiered broadcast/cable TV system</a> — and a future unequivocally bad for consumers, regardless of what the FCC may or may not decide <a href='http://voices.washingtonpost.com/posttech/2010/11/lawmakers_push_fcc_to_vote_on.html'>later this month</a>.</p><p>Consider this: as Comcast&#8217;s customers increasingly <a href='http://lifehacker.com/5667680/ditching-cable-for-the-web-how-much-can-you-save-buying-renting-or-streaming-tv'>look to their computers for video content</a> rather than their cable box, Comcast can either squeeze that lost revenue out of its customers by bringing an <a href='http://www.businessinsider.com/comcast-internet-access-2010-11'>end to all-you-can-eat Internet</a>, in which case we&#8217;ll see an increase in our cable bill, or they can make up that lost revenue on the other end, by charging contest providers (like Level 3) a surcharge, forcing those services to offset their increased overhead by passing along the cost in the form of monthly fees, in which case we&#8217;ll see it on our Netflix/iTunes/Facebook bill instead. Either way, the decision forecasts an inevitable flow of money from our pockets to Comcast&#8217;s.</p><p>Any time the nation&#8217;s <a href='http://www.comcast.com/About/PressRelease/PressReleaseDetail.ashx?PRID=887'>largest</a> anything makes a &#8221;<a href='http://www.comcast.net/articles/finance/20101130/US.Level.3.Comcast/'>take it or leave it</a>&#8221; offer demanding a fee for an otherwise mutually beneficial relationship like <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peering'>peering</a>, the transaction deserves a certain degree of scrutiny, especially when it creates a catch-22 in that company&#8217;s favor. Is Comcast <em>trying</em> to kill the Internet? Probably not. <em>Will</em> they? I guess we&#8217;re going to have to wait and see.</p><p><em>Views represent <a href='http://ben.balter.com/fine-print/'>my own</a>.</em></p><p><span>photo: <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnackgnackgnack/3592493739/'>gnackgnackgnack</a></span></p><p><span />: http://ben.balter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/3592493739_6b0b0d3f45_b.jpg</p>"

Exactly 120 years later, the first paper, <em>Kaiyuan Za Bao</em>, began production in Beijing. <sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> In 2010, however, China&#8217;s information landscape is best characterized not by innovation, but rather by tightly controlled government restriction, and no American corporation is more acutely aware of this austere reality than Internet giant Google. The company <a href='http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2010/11/promoting-free-trade-for-internet.html'>recently released</a> a <a href='http://www.google.com/googleblogs/pdfs/trade_free_flow_of_information.pdf'>white paper</a> calling out China, among others for violating WTO commitments and urged law makers to break down barriers to free trade and global e-commerce.</p><p><img alt='' src='http://cdn.benbalter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/1194563275_664d6b15e2_b.jpg' /></p><p>The argument is simple: As the internet is increasingly becoming the dominant instrument of industry, blocking access to information is tantamount to blocking access to trade.</p><p>The white paper elaborates:</p><blockquote><p>The tremendous spread of the Internet – faster than the spread of any previous technology – has also created new, rapidly expanding markets. Online traffic has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 66 percent over the past five years. <sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup> Today more than one-quarter of the world&#8217;s population (1.7 billion people) uses this technology to communicate, inform, create, and buy and sell across borders. <sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup> These 1.7 billion Internet users are a massive new consumer base for both Internet services like email and the hard goods and services that are increasingly advertised, marketed, or sold online…</p><p>Annual internet-based commerce worldwide is expected to soon reach $1 trillion. <sup id='fnref:4'><a href='#fn:4' rel='footnote'>4</a></sup>In the United States alone, online retail sales were over $132 billion in 2008. <sup id='fnref:5'><a href='#fn:5' rel='footnote'>5</a></sup> Globally, Internet and telecom services contributed 3.3 percent of GDP in 2004, compared with 1.8 percent in 1990, with virtually every single economy enjoying growth in the sector. <sup id='fnref:6'><a href='#fn:6' rel='footnote'>6</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>The commercialization of the internet and subsequent clash with government restriction is nothing new. US-based information technology companies have been doing business in China with relative success for quite some time. Yahoo!, Inc. was the first to enter the fray in 1998, launching a Chinese-language version of its popular search engine to compete with China&#8217;s domestic Internet content providers, and not long after, Microsoft and Google followed suit. <sup id='fnref:7'><a href='#fn:7' rel='footnote'>7</a></sup> However, in 2000, China&#8217;s Ministry of Public Service began the Golden Shield Project with the goal of &#8220;adopt<span>ing</span>… advanced information and communication technology to strengthen central police control, responsiveness, and crime combating capacity to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of police work. <sup id='fnref:8'><a href='#fn:8' rel='footnote'>8</a></sup>&#8221;</p><p><img alt='' src='http://cdn.benbalter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/4273568581_3c4db9799d_z-300x238.jpg' />A prime example of such restriction came in Fall 2002, as Google employees were booting up their Mountain View, California computers to angry emails informing them that the search engine was entirely unavailable to Chinese citizens. <sup id='fnref:9'><a href='#fn:9' rel='footnote'>9</a></sup> Even when users could access Google.com, the Web site was slow, often cases, inoperably so when compared to Google&#8217;s censored competitors. <sup id='fnref:10'><a href='#fn:10' rel='footnote'>10</a></sup> As Google&#8217;s Senior Policy Council, Andrew McLaughlin, noted, &#8220;Google.com appears to be down around 10 percent of the time,&#8221; adding, &#8221;<span>e</span>ven when users can reach it, the website is slow, and sometimes produces results that… stall out the user&#8217;s browser. <sup id='fnref:11'><a href='#fn:11' rel='footnote'>11</a></sup>&#8221;</p><p>So why do we care if a handful of countries do not enjoy unfettered access to American e-commerce? According to the China Internet Network Information Center, the Chinese market represents some 123 million Internet users. <sup id='fnref:12'><a href='#fn:12' rel='footnote'>12</a></sup> The Internet far surpassed television, newspapers, magazines, and radio as the primary source for information among the Chinese people. <sup id='fnref:13'><a href='#fn:13' rel='footnote'>13</a></sup> As a result, today, the People&#8217;s Republic represents the largest emerging Internet market in the world. Baidu.com, for example, the Chinese-based search engine, enjoyed only 2.5% of the search market in 2003, but boasted 46% by 2005, while during that same time, Google&#8217;s market share in China dropped some 30% and continued to fall. <sup id='fnref:14'><a href='#fn:14' rel='footnote'>14</a></sup></p><p>The implications are clear. The fastest, most powerful commercial vehicle the world has ever seen is unavailable to its largest emerging market. To put it another way, countries that censor internet traffic are blocking the 21st century&#8217;s busiest trade ports. It would be as if merchant ships in the 1500′s, full of goods from the New World, made their way back to Europe only to be turned away. Even in a post-dot-com-bubble world, with nearly ubiquitous free shipping, cyber Mondays, and an app store for everything from your phone to your toaster, it is not hard to imagine that the internet will soon become the dominant mechanism of international trade, if it has not earned such a title already. Today, one thing is certain: As the domestic e-commerce market reaches saturation, American firms will continue to seek out opportunities abroad despite censorship and restrictions. <sup id='fnref:15'><a href='#fn:15' rel='footnote'>15</a></sup> Their level of success, however, and the level of access available to users in the countries cited in the white paper, if any, remains to be seen.</p><p><span>Photos courtesy <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/1194563275/'>stuckincustoms</a> and <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/winterkanal/4273568581/'>winterkanal</a></span></p><p>Notes:</p><div class='footnotes'><hr /><ol><li id='fn:1'><p>Gardels, Nathan, <em>Google vs. Confucius</em>, 27 New Perspective Quarterly 2 (May 2010), at 2. <span>22</span></p><a href='#fnref:1' rev='footnote'>&#8617;</a></li><li id='fn:2'><p>Fed.

What&#8217;s really important is the capability to access your application anywhere, move it freely and easily, and inexpensively add resources.&#8221; <sup id='fnref:6'><a href='#fn:6' rel='footnote'>6</a></sup> In simplest terms, the cloud uses an off-site service to store, transmit, and process information, and employs the Internet as the means to access that service. <sup id='fnref:7'><a href='#fn:7' rel='footnote'>7</a></sup></p><p><strong>How Cloud Computing Came About</strong></p><p>Several innovations fueled the shift toward computing in the cloud. First, the rise and adoption of both broadband Internet access, which allowed for reduced load times, and a programming technique known as AJAX, which allowed Web sites to look and feel more like desktop programs through a constant push-and-pull of information, combined to usher in a greater reliance on remote applications. <sup id='fnref:8'><a href='#fn:8' rel='footnote'>8</a></sup> At the same time the growth of enterprise data centers, and the public&#8217;s increasing comfort with Web 2.0 services like GMail and Facebook provided a technical and social infrastructure to support such a push. <sup id='fnref:9'><a href='#fn:9' rel='footnote'>9</a></sup></p><p>The biggest breakthrough, however, the core and true power behind cloud computing, came from the consolidation of physical servers through system virtualization. Through virtualization, one physical server can become the host to many virtual servers. <sup id='fnref:10'><a href='#fn:10' rel='footnote'>10</a></sup> Because the resources are dynamically allocated across physical servers as the virtual servers require them, the physical resources are used more efficiently. <sup id='fnref:11'><a href='#fn:11' rel='footnote'>11</a></sup> If server <em>A</em>, say an e-mail server like one may see in most corporate or government offices sees a sudden spike in activity, rather than slowing, it can borrow resources from server <em>B</em>, a Web site hosted on the same physical server. The user, unaware that this shift has even occurred, sees the two servers as discrete and unconnected despite their physical location.</p><p>The biggest implication however, is that computing resources can be provisioned and released on demand and as needed. <sup id='fnref:12'><a href='#fn:12' rel='footnote'>12</a></sup> If agency <em>X</em> is a government agency that requires a great deal of information to be processed at the close of the stock market each day, it can pay for five servers up until 3:59 each day, be charged solely for the increased processing power and storage it requires from 4:00 to 4:05, and can return to five server for the remainder of the day. Under a traditional approach, all 100 servers, for example, it required at its peak, would have to be operational 24 hours a day, with the necessary personnel and infrastructure to support it.</p><p><strong>Types of Cloud Computing</strong></p><p>Cloud computing exists in several forms today. The most basic, &#8220;infrastructure as a service&#8221; (IAAS), uses shared facilities, hardware, and networks to hold and move data. Customers, given virtual servers, may then install, configure, and utilize their own software freely. <sup id='fnref:13'><a href='#fn:13' rel='footnote'>13</a></sup> As indicated above, however, customers do not rent the physical servers (merely their equivalent processing power), and providers may move virtual servers between physical servers as necessary. <sup id='fnref:14'><a href='#fn:14' rel='footnote'>14</a></sup> Amazon&#8217;s EC2, S3, and CloudFront are prime examples of cloud computing, storage, and delivery respectively.</p><p>Second, and slightly more advanced, &#8220;platform as a service&#8221; (PAAS) allows providers to serve customers with a shared computing platform and software environment. The customer can upload software code in a predetermined programming language (such as Java or PHP) and the provider executes that code and returns the result. <sup id='fnref:15'><a href='#fn:15' rel='footnote'>15</a></sup> Google Apps Engine is a prime example of such an arrangement.</p><p>Finally, &#8220;software as a service&#8221; (SAAS) is most associated with Web-based consumer services such as Facebook or Flickr but can find application in business and government environments as well. The provider hosts software designed to perform a specific function, such as social networking or photo sharing, and the user interacts with that application being run on the provider&#8217;s server. <sup id='fnref:16'><a href='#fn:16' rel='footnote'>16</a></sup></p><p>One additional distinction among cloud services can be made. Each of the three approaches listed above can be hosted in either a public cloud, meaning one customer&#8217;s virtual servers may be freely intermingled with another customer&#8217;s among physical servers, or in a private cloud in which the physical servers, infrastructure, or datacenter may be entirely segregated from those used to provide services to other clients. <sup id='fnref:17'><a href='#fn:17' rel='footnote'>17</a></sup></p><p><strong>Implications of Cloud Computing</strong></p><p>Cloud computing has several implication for members of the government contracting community. First, inherent in the nature of cloud computing is the fact that one organization must trust a third party with its data, something which may have far-reaching ethical and legal implication depending on the type of data stored and the parties involved.</p><p>More broadly, when contracting for cloud services, organizations have several technical aspects to take into account. From a security standpoint, customers should evaluate data encryption (can others access my data?), physical security (can others access the datacenter?), and provider viability (will the service be around in ten years?). From a data integrity standpoint, those looking to enter the cloud should inquire as to data locality (is my data being hosted outside the United States?), data portability (what happens if I want to leave the service?), and redundancy (what happens if there is a natural disaster near their data center?). Finally, from a legal perspective, customers should evaluate terms of service, privacy policies, and service level (uptime) agreements. <sup id='fnref:18'><a href='#fn:18' rel='footnote'>18</a></sup></p><p><strong>How to Get Into the Cloud</strong></p><p>Several avenues exist for organizations looking to experiment with the cloud. For federal agencies, the General Service Administration, through Apps.gov, will soon be rolling out a Federal private cloud. While the specifics have not yet been announced, this service is expected to provide federal agencies with storage, virtual machine, and Web hosting services at a relatively low cost. <sup id='fnref:19'><a href='#fn:19' rel='footnote'>19</a></sup> Some of this service&#8217;s potential has already been hinted at by the recent launch of Apps.Gov NOW, a hosted service that provides federal agencies with out-of-the-box blogs (Web site publishing platforms), Wikis (Web sites editable by members of a community), and online bulletin boards (Web sites to facilitate online discussions), all at no cost. <sup id='fnref:20'><a href='#fn:20' rel='footnote'>20</a></sup></p><p>Second, many federal Web sites such as the Federal Communications Commission and Recovery.Gov are in the process of seeking or have already sought third-party cloud hosting services likes Amazon Web Services (AWS) as mentioned above. <sup id='fnref:21'><a href='#fn:21' rel='footnote'>21</a></sup> Federal agencies opting for such a route must be sure to work closely with the appropriate parties to ensure, federal IT security standards are met, such as FISMA <sup id='fnref:22'><a href='#fn:22' rel='footnote'>22</a></sup> requirements, or that record retention standards are met, for example, where data stored in the cloud constitutes a system of records under the privacy act. <sup id='fnref:23'><a href='#fn:23' rel='footnote'>23</a></sup></p><p>Finally, earlier this summer, Google announced FISMA moderate certification of its Google Apps for Government data centers, providing mail, calendar, document, video, and Web hosting services to Federal agencies in a private cloud hosted entirely within the United States. <sup id='fnref:24'><a href='#fn:24' rel='footnote'>24</a></sup> Agencies wishing to contract their traditional IT infrastructure out to Google can do so for as low as $50 per user per year, however, such savings may come at a cost. Special attention must be paid to the risks associated with trusting a third-party with what may potentially be an agency&#8217;s most sensitive data.</p><p>Whether a federal contracting officer or a provider of IT services, just as the Internet has revolutionized countless aspects of every day life, it is clear that so too will the emerging cloud computing front forever shape the contours of Federal IT procurement in the years to come.</p><p><em>This article originally published in the <a href='http://www.fedbar.org/Sections/Government-Contracts-Section/Newsletters.aspx'>Federal Bar Association Government Contracts Section</a> <a href='http://www.fedbar.org/Sections/Government-Contracts-Section/Newsletters/Fall-2010.aspx?FT=.pdf'>Fall 2010 Newsletter</a> (PDF, p. 6).&lt;/p&gt; Notes:</em></p><div class='footnotes'><hr /><ol><li id='fn:1'><p>Stephen Lawson, <em>Cloud is Internet&#8217;s Next Generation, HP Executive Says</em>, InfoWorld, June 25, 2009, http://www.infoworld.com/d/cloud-computing/cloud-internets-next-generation-hp-executive-says-120 (quoting HP CTO Russ Daniels). <span>27</span></p><a href='#fnref:1' rev='footnote'>&#8617;</a></li><li id='fn:2'><p><em>See Generally</em>Jack Newton, <em>Putting Your Practice in the Cloud a Pre-Flight Checklist</em>, 73 Tex.

Just as it is second nature for city dwellers to walk past solicitors handing out pamphlets on the street corner, as the culture surrounding the technology continues to evolve so too will Twitter community begin to ostracize those members who refuse to join the ongoing digital dialog.</p><p>Simply put, Twitter is not a dumping ground for pre-vetted paper.<sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup> The occasional typo or personal quip doesn&#8217;t hurt a company&#8217;s reputation, but rather humanizes it.

Many personal Web sites used lackluster TinyMCE formatting (bold, italic, bullets, nothing else) or simply stuffed pre-styled HTML into an existing page. I can&#8217;t even begin to fathom the workflows some people must go through every time they want to update their resume.<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> A few purpose-built plugins offered a slightly more streamlined approach, but cluttered the backend with unnecessary and unfamiliar menus, and spawned legions of database tables to store the data.</p><p><em>Enter WP Resume…</em></p><p>WP Resume is an out-of-the-box solution to get your resume online and keep it updated.
