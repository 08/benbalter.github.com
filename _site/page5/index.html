      <h2 id='a_brief_look_at_the_imminent_cloudcomputing_storm_front'>A Brief Look at the Imminent Cloud-Computing Storm Front</h2><p>As one Hewlett-Packard chief executive recently put it, cloud computing &#8220;is the next generation of the internet.&#8221; <sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> Whether you realize it or not, if you use services like Facebook or Gmail, your personal data already lives in &#8220;the cloud,&#8221; and the same transformative power that connects long-lost classmates at the click of a mouse can be harnessed by federal agencies to approach modern governance in incredibly powerful ways.</p><p><strong>What is Cloud Computing?</strong></p><p>Traditionally, when one thinks of computing power, he or she thinks of an on-site datacenter — a room filled with blinking lights and whirling fans — hardware, software, and data storage all within feet of the users they serve. <sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup> The traditional approach to computing generally entails complicated and expensive upgrade procedures scheduled on a semi-regular basis, as well as accommodating the increasing demand for backup and recovery redundancy necessary to reduce downtime should these system fails. <sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup> Such datacenters are often managed by their own departments, staffed with the specialized, technical administrators needed to maintain and ensure the day-to-day operation of these increasingly complex and increasingly mission-critical business resources. <sup id='fnref:4'><a href='#fn:4' rel='footnote'>4</a></sup></p><p>Seen as a virtually unlimited hardware and communications infrastructure managed by a third party-provider, cloud computing, on the other hand, allows for rapid increases in capacity without the need to invest in additional hardware, personnel, or software licensing. <sup id='fnref:5'><a href='#fn:5' rel='footnote'>5</a></sup> &#8220;As a customer, you don&#8217;t know where the resources are, and for the most part, you don&#8217;t care. What&#8217;s really important is the capability to access your application anywhere, move it freely and easily, and inexpensively add resources.&#8221; <sup id='fnref:6'><a href='#fn:6' rel='footnote'>6</a></sup> In simplest terms, the cloud uses an off-site service to store, transmit, and process information, and employs the Internet as the means to access that service. <sup id='fnref:7'><a href='#fn:7' rel='footnote'>7</a></sup></p><p><strong>How Cloud Computing Came About</strong></p><p>Several innovations fueled the shift toward computing in the cloud. First, the rise and adoption of both broadband Internet access, which allowed for reduced load times, and a programming technique known as AJAX, which allowed Web sites to look and feel more like desktop programs through a constant push-and-pull of information, combined to usher in a greater reliance on remote applications. <sup id='fnref:8'><a href='#fn:8' rel='footnote'>8</a></sup> At the same time the growth of enterprise data centers, and the public&#8217;s increasing comfort with Web 2.0 services like GMail and Facebook provided a technical and social infrastructure to support such a push. <sup id='fnref:9'><a href='#fn:9' rel='footnote'>9</a></sup></p><p>The biggest breakthrough, however, the core and true power behind cloud computing, came from the consolidation of physical servers through system virtualization. Through virtualization, one physical server can become the host to many virtual servers. <sup id='fnref:10'><a href='#fn:10' rel='footnote'>10</a></sup> Because the resources are dynamically allocated across physical servers as the virtual servers require them, the physical resources are used more efficiently. <sup id='fnref:11'><a href='#fn:11' rel='footnote'>11</a></sup> If server <em>A</em>, say an e-mail server like one may see in most corporate or government offices sees a sudden spike in activity, rather than slowing, it can borrow resources from server <em>B</em>, a Web site hosted on the same physical server. The user, unaware that this shift has even occurred, sees the two servers as discrete and unconnected despite their physical location.</p><p>The biggest implication however, is that computing resources can be provisioned and released on demand and as needed. <sup id='fnref:12'><a href='#fn:12' rel='footnote'>12</a></sup> If agency <em>X</em> is a government agency that requires a great deal of information to be processed at the close of the stock market each day, it can pay for five servers up until 3:59 each day, be charged solely for the increased processing power and storage it requires from 4:00 to 4:05, and can return to five server for the remainder of the day. Under a traditional approach, all 100 servers, for example, it required at its peak, would have to be operational 24 hours a day, with the necessary personnel and infrastructure to support it.</p><p><strong>Types of Cloud Computing</strong></p><p>Cloud computing exists in several forms today. The most basic, &#8220;infrastructure as a service&#8221; (IAAS), uses shared facilities, hardware, and networks to hold and move data. Customers, given virtual servers, may then install, configure, and utilize their own software freely. <sup id='fnref:13'><a href='#fn:13' rel='footnote'>13</a></sup> As indicated above, however, customers do not rent the physical servers (merely their equivalent processing power), and providers may move virtual servers between physical servers as necessary. <sup id='fnref:14'><a href='#fn:14' rel='footnote'>14</a></sup> Amazon&#8217;s EC2, S3, and CloudFront are prime examples of cloud computing, storage, and delivery respectively.</p><p>Second, and slightly more advanced, &#8220;platform as a service&#8221; (PAAS) allows providers to serve customers with a shared computing platform and software environment. The customer can upload software code in a predetermined programming language (such as Java or PHP) and the provider executes that code and returns the result. <sup id='fnref:15'><a href='#fn:15' rel='footnote'>15</a></sup> Google Apps Engine is a prime example of such an arrangement.</p><p>Finally, &#8220;software as a service&#8221; (SAAS) is most associated with Web-based consumer services such as Facebook or Flickr but can find application in business and government environments as well. The provider hosts software designed to perform a specific function, such as social networking or photo sharing, and the user interacts with that application being run on the provider&#8217;s server. <sup id='fnref:16'><a href='#fn:16' rel='footnote'>16</a></sup></p><p>One additional distinction among cloud services can be made. Each of the three approaches listed above can be hosted in either a public cloud, meaning one customer&#8217;s virtual servers may be freely intermingled with another customer&#8217;s among physical servers, or in a private cloud in which the physical servers, infrastructure, or datacenter may be entirely segregated from those used to provide services to other clients. <sup id='fnref:17'><a href='#fn:17' rel='footnote'>17</a></sup></p><p><strong>Implications of Cloud Computing</strong></p><p>Cloud computing has several implication for members of the government contracting community. First, inherent in the nature of cloud computing is the fact that one organization must trust a third party with its data, something which may have far-reaching ethical and legal implication depending on the type of data stored and the parties involved.</p><p>More broadly, when contracting for cloud services, organizations have several technical aspects to take into account. From a security standpoint, customers should evaluate data encryption (can others access my data?), physical security (can others access the datacenter?), and provider viability (will the service be around in ten years?). From a data integrity standpoint, those looking to enter the cloud should inquire as to data locality (is my data being hosted outside the United States?), data portability (what happens if I want to leave the service?), and redundancy (what happens if there is a natural disaster near their data center?). Finally, from a legal perspective, customers should evaluate terms of service, privacy policies, and service level (uptime) agreements. <sup id='fnref:18'><a href='#fn:18' rel='footnote'>18</a></sup></p><p><strong>How to Get Into the Cloud</strong></p><p>Several avenues exist for organizations looking to experiment with the cloud. For federal agencies, the General Service Administration, through Apps.gov, will soon be rolling out a Federal private cloud. While the specifics have not yet been announced, this service is expected to provide federal agencies with storage, virtual machine, and Web hosting services at a relatively low cost. <sup id='fnref:19'><a href='#fn:19' rel='footnote'>19</a></sup> Some of this service&#8217;s potential has already been hinted at by the recent launch of Apps.Gov NOW, a hosted service that provides federal agencies with out-of-the-box blogs (Web site publishing platforms), Wikis (Web sites editable by members of a community), and online bulletin boards (Web sites to facilitate online discussions), all at no cost. <sup id='fnref:20'><a href='#fn:20' rel='footnote'>20</a></sup></p><p>Second, many federal Web sites such as the Federal Communications Commission and Recovery.Gov are in the process of seeking or have already sought third-party cloud hosting services likes Amazon Web Services (AWS) as mentioned above. <sup id='fnref:21'><a href='#fn:21' rel='footnote'>21</a></sup> Federal agencies opting for such a route must be sure to work closely with the appropriate parties to ensure, federal IT security standards are met, such as FISMA <sup id='fnref:22'><a href='#fn:22' rel='footnote'>22</a></sup> requirements, or that record retention standards are met, for example, where data stored in the cloud constitutes a system of records under the privacy act. <sup id='fnref:23'><a href='#fn:23' rel='footnote'>23</a></sup></p><p>Finally, earlier this summer, Google announced FISMA moderate certification of its Google Apps for Government data centers, providing mail, calendar, document, video, and Web hosting services to Federal agencies in a private cloud hosted entirely within the United States. <sup id='fnref:24'><a href='#fn:24' rel='footnote'>24</a></sup> Agencies wishing to contract their traditional IT infrastructure out to Google can do so for as low as $50 per user per year, however, such savings may come at a cost. Special attention must be paid to the risks associated with trusting a third-party with what may potentially be an agency&#8217;s most sensitive data.</p><p>Whether a federal contracting officer or a provider of IT services, just as the Internet has revolutionized countless aspects of every day life, it is clear that so too will the emerging cloud computing front forever shape the contours of Federal IT procurement in the years to come.</p><p><em>This article originally published in the <a href='http://www.fedbar.org/Sections/Government-Contracts-Section/Newsletters.aspx'>Federal Bar Association Government Contracts Section</a> <a href='http://www.fedbar.org/Sections/Government-Contracts-Section/Newsletters/Fall-2010.aspx?FT=.pdf'>Fall 2010 Newsletter</a> (PDF, p. 6).&lt;/p&gt; Notes:</em></p><div class='footnotes'><hr /><ol><li id='fn:1'>

      <p><a href='http://ben.balter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/4502026170_4bf31f04e6.jpg' />Today&#8217;s New York Times article <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/27/us/27wiretap.html?_r=1&amp;ref=technology' title='NYT: U.S. Tries to Make It Easier to Wiretap the Internet'>outlining law enforcement officials&#8217; attempts to expand their digital wiretapping authority</a>, offers interesting insight into the law enforcement world of tomorrow. In the not too distant future, TV&#8217;s crime-process dramas may take on a very different feel. Gone will be the days of <a href='http://www.hulu.com/watch/53368/swat-best-of-breaches' title='Hulu: Best of Swatch Breaches'>gun-toting detectives busting down doors, search warrant in hand</a>. Instead, as our lives become increasingly digital, investigations will be conducted by <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z70BmmSkMY&amp;feature=related' title='CSI Miami IP Address Lookup'>keyboard-wielding lab techs submitting automated requests to service providers</a>. Don&#8217;t be surprised if the next CSI spinoff is CSI: Inbox Inspectors Division.</p><p>But why does this shift matter? Simply put, in <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing' title='Wikipedia: Cloud Computing'>the cloud</a>, there is no door for the police to kick in. While the law is clear in that your physical files and those computer files stored on your computer itself enjoy the protections of the fourth amendment, those stored in the cloud do not, and the standards of proof required differ dramatically.<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup></p><p><img alt='' src='http://ben.balter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/4502026170_4bf31f04e6.jpg' /></p><p>Consider this: you are the target of a criminal investigation and the police believe that six months ago you e-mailed an accomplice to discuss the crime. Depending on your e-mail settings and which service you use (e.g., if the &#8221;<a href='http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/leave-e-mail-messages-on-your-e-mail-server-HA001150793.aspx'>leave downloaded messages on server</a>&#8221; option is checked), the police may need only offer &#8220;specific and articulable facts&#8221; that they suspect the e-mail is related to the crime.<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup> That same e-mail stored on your computer (e.g., if the setting is not checked), would require a search warrant and showing of probable cause, and thus would be afforded significantly greater protections under the law.<sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup></p><p>However, the typical &#8221;<em>if you don&#8217;t want it public, don&#8217;t put it on the internet</em>&#8221; argument doesn&#8217;t apply here. While that may be true for <a href='http://youropenbook.org/' title='Your Open Book'>photos and updates posted to social networking sites</a>, as more and more of our lives (and <a href='http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/customers.html' title='Google Business Customers'>commercial dealings</a>) are pushed to the cloud, we&#8217;re loosing our abilities to have a digital private sphere.<sup id='fnref:4'><a href='#fn:4' rel='footnote'>4</a></sup></p><p>The good news is that it&#8217;s in service providers&#8217; interest to instill confidence in the integrity of your data by <a href='http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/governmentrequests/' title='Google Government Inqueries'>disclosing when information is shared with authorities</a> and by <a href='http://digitaldueprocess.org/index.cfm?objectid=37940370-2551-11DF-8E02000C296BA163' title='Digital Due Process'>pushing for legal reform</a>to better safeguard personal data stored in the cloud. The bad news, beyond more <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkDD03yeLnU' title='YouTube: CSI Blog Search'>painfully tacky computer search scenes</a>, is that before we know it, our perception of privacy may be forced to evolve.</p><p>Thunderstorms occur when divergent forces collide in clouds. It is becoming increasingly clear that cloud computing is in our extended forecast, but whether the imminent <a href='http://digitaldueprocess.org/'>digital due process</a> storm the cloud foreshadows will contain a silver privacy lining remains to be seen.</p><p>Photo credit: <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/garyhayes/4502026170/'>garyhayes</a></p><div class='footnotes'><hr /><ol><li id='fn:1'>

      <p>A recent <a href='http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2010/09/07/Opinions/gwtoday.Stop.Damaging.Gws.Reputation-3928003.shtml'>back</a> and <a href='http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2010/09/13/Opinions/Conor.Rogers.jguiffre.Pls.Refudiate-3930388.shtml'>forth</a> in the opinion pages of GW&#8217;s paper of note brought to light an emerging divide in publicists&#8217; approaches to social media. One the one hand, GW&#8217;s primary Twitter account, @GWTweets, casts the University in a stoic, buttoned-up light, with little, if any interactions with members of the rather active online community (<em>e.g.</em>, mentions, @replies, or ReTweets). @GWToday on the other hand, the <em>de facto</em>hub of the campus&#8217;s Twitter scene, and arguably a <a href='http://www.socialmediahighered.com/'>significant presence in higher education&#8217;s social media world</a>, has historically taken a more cavalier approach to serving as the University&#8217;s digital face. But which approach is &#8220;best&#8221;?</p><p><img alt='' src='http://cdn.benbalter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/3708549622_42a7d7e450_o-1024x363.jpg' /></p><p>Technology has the bad habit of upsetting social norms, and as much as we try, there&#8217;s nothing we can do to stop it.<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> Organizations looking to establish a presence on Twitter cannot afford to treat social media like other media they may have encountered. Social media is not a megaphone for a flaks to broadcast the press releases they would otherwise post elsewhere, but rather a cocktail party that provide organizations with the unique opportunity to loosen their tie, grab a drink, and work the room.</p><p>There is a generation of communications directors and public affairs vice presidents out there that see the liberalizing power of social media as a <em>liability</em>, rather than an <em>opportunity</em>. Personal interaction with stakeholders, be they students at a university or just those who enjoy <a href='http://twitter.com/jimmyjohns'>delicious, delicious sandwiches</a>,<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup> allow organizations to connect with the people most passionate about their brand in a very real way. Just as it is second nature for city dwellers to walk past solicitors handing out pamphlets on the street corner, as the culture surrounding the technology continues to evolve so too will Twitter community begin to ostracize those members who refuse to join the ongoing digital dialog.</p><p>Simply put, Twitter is not a dumping ground for pre-vetted paper.<sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup> The occasional typo or personal quip doesn&#8217;t hurt a company&#8217;s reputation, but rather humanizes it. So long as @GWToday (or any corporate handle for that matter) falls short of sharing a <a href='http://search.twitter.com/search?q=nom+twitpic'>picture of what they&#8217;re having for lunch</a>, we can only hope that they continue to be the model for establishing an online presence, rather than the exception.</p><p><em>[Photo: <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/tranchis/3708549622/'>tranchis</a>]</em></p><div class='footnotes'><hr /><ol><li id='fn:1'>
<p>Without too much of a history lesson, see, e.g., Abraham Lincoln overseeing the Civil War from the telegraph office ushering in a new era of hands-on presidential leadership; home telephones giving rise to entire industries dedicated to interrupting families&#8217; dinners; Blackberrys changing business e-mail etiquette.</p>
<a href='#fnref:1' rev='footnote'>&#8617;</a></li><li id='fn:2'>
<p>Jimmy John&#8217;s often frat-boy-esq vocabulary may push the limits of informal interactions with stakeholders, but none-the-less serves to promote their brand.</p>

      <p>As I began to set up my own site, I was not a huge fan of the options out there for adding a resume or CV to a WordPress blog. Many personal Web sites used lackluster TinyMCE formatting (bold, italic, bullets, nothing else) or simply stuffed pre-styled HTML into an existing page. I can&#8217;t even begin to fathom the workflows some people must go through every time they want to update their resume.<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> A few purpose-built plugins offered a slightly more streamlined approach, but cluttered the backend with unnecessary and unfamiliar menus, and spawned legions of database tables to store the data.</p><p><em>Enter WP Resume…</em></p><p>WP Resume is an out-of-the-box solution to get your resume online and keep it updated. Built on WordPress 3.0&#8217;s custom post type functionality, it offers a uniquely familiar approach to publishing. If you&#8217;ve got a WordPress site, you already know how to use WP Resume.</p><p><strong>Features include:</strong></p><ul>
<li>Support for sections (e.g., education, experience), organizations (e.g., somewhere state university, Cogs, Inc.), positions (e.g., bachelor of arts, chief widget specialist), and details (e.g., grew bottom line by 15%, president of the sustainability club)</li>

<li>Follows best practices in resume layout and design</li>

<li>One click install, just start adding content</li>

<li>Drag and drop ordering of resume elements</li>

<li>Built on existing WordPress code, utilizing a single custom post type and two custom taxonomies</li>

<li>The WYSIWYG editing experience you know and love</li>

<li>Revisioning</li>

<li>Integrates with your theme like they were made for each other</li>

<li>Custom URL</li>

<li>Does not use pretentious accents on the word &#8220;resume&#8221;</li>

<li>Extremely original title</li>
</ul><p><img alt='' src='http://cdn.benbalter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/wp_resume-300x223.png' />The hardest part of getting your resume online should be doing the work listed on it, not wrestling the publishing platform. Simply put, WP Resume steps aside and lets your experience shine.</p><p>Interested? You can <a href='http://ben.balter.com/resume/'>see it in action</a>, or if you&#8217;re ready to take the plunge, <a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-resume/'>download it from the WordPress plugin repository</a>, and <a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-resume/installation/'>try it today</a>. There&#8217;s even a <a href='http://tech.journalism.cuny.edu/documentation/wp-resume/'>great walkthrough put together by the good folks at CUNY Graduate School of Journalism.</a> Bugs, questions, comments, feedback? I&#8217;d love to hear about your experience with WP Resume in the comments below.</p><p><em>Enjoy using WP Resume? Feel free to <a href='http://ben.balter.com/donate/' title='Donate'>make a small donation</a> to support the software&#8217;s continued development.</em></p><p><em>[Photo: <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/shawnmichael/4246330043/'>shawnmichael</a>]</em></p><div class='footnotes'><hr /><ol><li id='fn:1'>
