      <blockquote>
<p>&#8220;In 1876, the president of Western Union brushed off Alexander Graham Bell&#8217;s telephone as little more than an &#8221;<em>electric toy</em>,&#8221; and the company called Bell&#8217;s proposal to put one in every home &#8221;<em>utterly out of the question</em>.&#8221; Oxford University professor Erasmus Wilson predicted that when the 1878 Paris Exhibition closed, the electric light would &#8221;<em>close with it and no more will be heard of it</em>.&#8221; A Michigan banker advised his client not to invest in Henry Ford&#8217;s company in 1903 because &#8221;<em>the horse is here to stay, but the automobile is only a novelty</em>.&#8221; …If there is one constant through out time, it&#8217;s that conventional wisdom often misses the mark, especially in the early days of technological transformation.&#8221; <sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve never heard any individual, upon being asked what they thought of a recent automobile purchase respond, &#8221;<em>well, it&#8217;s got this weird ‘new car&#8217; smell, so it&#8217;s going to take some getting used to</em>.&#8221; <sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup> Yet for many, such is the typical reaction to experiencing a new technology. <sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup></p>

<p>What is it about technological progress that sends many running for their digital security blankets? <sup id='fnref:4'><a href='#fn:4' rel='footnote'>4</a></sup> For some reason, much of the resistance appears to be <a href='http://opensource.sys-con.com/node/692407'>uniformed doubt</a> (<em>e.g.</em>, &#8220;It&#8217;s different&#8221;), rather than <a href='http://www.infoworld.com/d/security-central/gartner-seven-cloud-computing-security-risks-853'>calculated avoidance</a> (<em>e.g.</em>, &#8220;It&#8217;s less secure because you can&#8217;t prevent X&#8221;). To be fair, the business world, and even more so CIO&#8217;s, see avoiding uncertainty and minimizing risk as a core competency, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the whole story.</p>

<p>The rapid pace of innovation has rendered many stakeholders and decision makers out of the loop when it comes to where a given technology stands in relation to their current practices, and for good reason: disruptive technology poses a risk not only on a organization level, but on a personal level as well.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>From a practical standpoint</strong>, all other things remaining constant, a firm&#8217;s move to the cloud, for example, <a href='http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/news/1381193/IT-job-security-fears-over-cloud-computing-Network-jobs-still-vital'>brings into question the security of the sysadmin</a> that has spent years building up a fiefdom of server farms.</li>

<li><strong>From a skills standpoint</strong>, there&#8217;s a whole generation out there that grew up on the Internet, and many of those in a position to make purchasing decisions or recommendation are simply not part of it. A young upstart consultant coming in and showing up the veteran can potentially be a recurring (and realistic) <a href='http://www.lexjansen.com/pharmasug/2000/techtech/tt16.pdf'>nightmare for many baby boomers</a>.</li>

<li><strong>From a professional standpoint</strong>, at its most basic level, risk is taken by individuals (who propose a new system, procedure, etc.), which in many organizations may have an incentive to adopt a &#8220;don&#8217;t rock the boat&#8221; mentality for their own career&#8217;s sake, rather than <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betamax'>risk being wrong</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If technological innovation were simply a matter of calculated risk and switching costs, one would expect firms to be <em>equally</em> as unlikely to upgrade an existing technology as they would be to switch to a new one. Mathematically, upgrading in-house servers to the next version of Microsoft Exchange may<a href='http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/messaging_value.html'>far outweigh</a> a move to the cloud. Yet, large firms have been <a href='http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2009/07/paving-road-to-apps-adoption-in-large.html'>slow to make the change</a>.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a whole world out there of distributed, open innovation that, with the exception of a few startups, <sup id='fnref:5'><a href='#fn:5' rel='footnote'>5</a></sup> has been widely ignored by IT departments, and as Yochai Benkler argues in <em><a href='http://www.amazon.com/Wealth-Networks-Production-Transforms-Markets/dp/0300110561'>The Wealth of Networks</a>,</em> if history suggests anything, it is that the proprietary model is on its way to the endangered species list.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s the answer? How can open source fanatics and other early adopters rescue the change averse from their self-perpetuated anachronisms?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Talk about <em>solutions</em> not technology</strong> – Geeks love shiny new things. It&#8217;s in our DNA. Yet rarely are geeks the one making the decisions. Decision makers could often care less which acronym powers something, but rather than dumb things down (&#8220;this thingy talks to that thingy&#8221;), translate the situation in terms of <a href='http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newPPM_82.htm'>organizational change</a> (&#8220;it will wholly eliminate the need for paper forms&#8221;). Rarely does technology change without the organization following suit. <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Solution-Selling-Creating-Difficult-Markets/dp/0786303158'>Approach the situation as a human problem</a>, not a technical one.</li>

<li><strong>Move past &#8221;</strong><strong><em>If it ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it&#8221;** – &#8221;<em>It&#8217;s good enough&#8221; should never be a persuasive argument for stagnation. Just because something has been used in the past, does not mean that it should. <sup id='fnref:6'><a href='#fn:6' rel='footnote'>6</a></sup> &lt;/em&gt;In software development, changes fit into one of two categories: bugs and enhancements. Saying that something &#8220;works&#8221; ignores exactly half of the equation.</em></em></strong></li>

<li><strong>Broadcast excellence</strong>- If you ask me why an organization should use SharePoint, I have at my fingertips <a href='http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/product/benefits/Pages/default.aspx'>focus-group tested ammunition</a>. Ask my why you should use WordPress, and I&#8217;m <a href='https://encrypted.google.com/webhp?oei=4HNeTqaVEsb50gGCldE7#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;newwindow=1&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=hp&amp;q=Why+Wordpress%3F+site%3Awordpress.org&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=Why+Wordpress%3F+site:wordpress.org&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=3748l3748l0l4002l1l1l0l0l0l0l128l128l0.1l1l0&amp;qscrl=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;fp=4bf87fb63526ad5b&amp;biw=1123&amp;bih=733'>left to pretty much fend for myself</a>. Curators of innovative technology need to make themselves known, and give those empowered to affect change, the tools to do so.</li>
</ul>

<p>The future&#8217;s coming. That&#8217;s for sure. Change is inevitable. Firms looking to seek a competitive advantage will begin to look past &#8221;<em>it has to be expensive and complicated</em>&#8221; and start looking toward open-source software, not as a misfit alternative, but as a viable player in the software space, but before that can happen the open-source community must step it up, and strive to be the serious competitor they wish to be treated as.</p>

<p><strong>Update (9/1):</strong>Not quite &#8220;focus-group tested ammunition,&#8221; but in a sort of meta-dogfooding, I took a stab at articulating &#8221;<a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/09/01/why-wordpress/'>Why WordPress</a>.&#8221; Edits welcome.</p>
