  The Case for Rebooting Federal IT Procurement
</h2>

*41 Pub. Cont. L.J. 149  
The Public Contract Law Journal, Fall 2011 *

* *

Like many government computer systems, the U.S. federal information technology (IT) procurement model is slow, outdated, and long overdue for a reboot. <a class="simple-footnote" title="This holds true for both civilian and military procurement systems.  See generally Office of the Under Sec&#8217;y of Def. for Acquisition, Tech., and Logistics, Report of the Defense Science Board Task Force on Department of Defense Policies and Procedures for the Acquisition of Information Technology (2009) [hereinafter DoD Acquisition Report]." id="return-note-2020-1" href="#note-2020-1"><sup>1</sup></a>  As the largest single purchaser of code, <a class="simple-footnote" title="Jay P.

Compounding the problem, end users fail entirely to use nearly forty-five percent of features procured and rarely use another nineteen percent of those features. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Szalvay, supra note 6, at 8." id="return-note-2020-9" href="#note-2020-9"><sup>9</sup></a>  Thus, <span class="pullquote">purchasing agencies ultimately utilize only about one-third of all features paid for by American tax dollars</span>. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Id." id="return-note-2020-10" href="#note-2020-10"><sup>10</sup></a>  In the end, nearly forty-five percent of federally procured software features ultimately fail to meet the user’s needs. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Gwanhoo Lee & Weidong Xia, Toward Agile: An Integrated Analysis of Quantitative and Qualitative Field Data on Software Development Agility, 34 MIS Q. 87, 88 (2010)." id="return-note-2020-11" href="#note-2020-11"><sup>11</sup></a>  It is therefore no surprise that the Secretary of the Department of Defense (DoD) Robert Gates called federal IT procurement “baroque.” <a class="simple-footnote" title="Robert Gates, A Balanced Strategy: Reprogramming the Pentagon for a New Age, Foreign Aff., Jan./Feb. 2009, at 28, 34." id="return-note-2020-12" href="#note-2020-12"><sup>12</sup></a>  Too often IT procurement requirements are crafted with the input of neither end-users nor product developers. <a class="simple-footnote" title="See Vivek Kundra, U.S. Chief Info. Officer, White House, 25 Point Implementation Plan to Reform Federal Information Technology Management 17 (2010) (calling for &#8220;increased communication with industry&#8221; and &#8220;high functioning, ‘cross-trained&#8217; program teams&#8221;)." id="return-note-2020-13" href="#note-2020-13"><sup>13</sup></a>  As Office of Management Budget (OMB) Director Peter R.

To better embrace innovation and respond to changing organizational needs, the Government must embrace a two-pronged approach involving both regulatory reform and top-down support for best-practices education to empower IT-procuring agencies to pursue more agile software development methods.  By requiring that detailed specifications be outlined at the onset of the process, government procurement regulations encourage the less flexible, waterfall development techniques, rather than the more modern, agile development approaches used by the private sector today. <a class="simple-footnote" title="DoD Acquisition Report, supra note 1, at 16-17 (noting many large corporations have gained a significant advantage from using agile).  See White House Forum On Modernizing Gov&#8217;t, Overview And Next Steps 9 (&#8220;Federal IT projects are too often marked by milestones spaced too far apart.&#8221;).  See generally infra Parts III-IV." id="return-note-2020-16" href="#note-2020-16"><sup>16</sup></a>  While most prior attempts to reform federal IT procurement focused solely on statutory changes, <a class="simple-footnote" title="See Ralph C.

  I. Background — Waterfall v. Agile
</h2>

Two primary schools of thought exist regarding software development practices: waterfall and agile software development.  While today’s contracting regulations may propel agencies to use waterfall development, changes in industry practice with regard to large IT projects demands a government push toward more agile methodologies.

  A. Waterfall Software Development Sees Modern Software Development as an Extension of its Traditional Engineering Roots
</h3>

The traditional approach, “waterfall” software development, <a class="simple-footnote" title="A more in-depth examination of the characteristics of waterfall development is discussed infra part II." id="return-note-2020-18" href="#note-2020-18"><sup>18</sup></a> seeks all requirements and specifications up front, distinguishing design and analysis from construction and development. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Adrian Royce, Agile in Government: Successful On-Time Delivery of Software 1, in Conference Papers, 20th Australian Software Engineering Conference (2009)." id="return-note-2020-19" href="#note-2020-19"><sup>19</sup></a>  Waterfall development techniques trace their roots to long-standing engineering fields such as architecture and electrical engineering. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Martin Fowler, The New Methodology, Martin Fowler (Dec. 13, 2005), http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/newMethodology.html." id="return-note-2020-20" href="#note-2020-20"><sup>20</sup></a>  In such fields, late changes are costly and rigid requirements are a practical necessity. <a class="simple-footnote" title="For example, an architect draws up blueprints for a house and hands them off to a contractor for construction.  Should the future homeowner decide after the fact that he wishes to deviate from his original plan, e.g., he prefers the kitchen be five feet wider, such a change would incur substantial time, labor, and material costs as floors are re-laid, pipes re-plumbed, and electrical outlets rewired accordingly." id="return-note-2020-21" href="#note-2020-21"><sup>21</sup></a>  With the rise of software development in the latter half of the twentieth century, engineers applied the same methodology to developing computer software.

Despite their similar roots, traditional engineering is not a perfect metaphor for software development. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Initially the application of the traditional methodology to the emerging field was much more straightforward.  Room-sized mainframe computers required users to painstakingly code instructions on physical cards, submit them to be processed in batches, and await the result. James O. Coplien & Gertrud Bjørnvig, Lean Architecture: For Agile Software Development, 218 (2010).  Today, however, advances in technology and the personal computer have allowed the software development environment to embody an interactive process whereby software engineers can receive immediate feedback as to their software&#8217;s success or failure. Id. at 218-19 (noting that originally high computing costs drove up the cost of mistakes such that &#8220;rigid disciplines ruled.&#8221; Today, mistakes are cheap.)." id="return-note-2020-22" href="#note-2020-22"><sup>22</sup></a>  First, unlike traditional engineering fields, software development benefits from nearly negligible switching costs. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Fowler, supra note 20.  If a federal agency decides that the navigation menu on its new website should be five pixels larger, to make such a change would simply require modifying one or two values in the website&#8217;s source code, an insubstantial labor cost in a large government contract." id="return-note-2020-23" href="#note-2020-23"><sup>23</sup></a>  Second, the bulk of most software development projects is design and system architecture, a process requiring creative and analytical, rather than technical talent. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Id." id="return-note-2020-24" href="#note-2020-24"><sup>24</sup></a>  In a world of widely adopted industry conventions, the creative necessities of a large-scale procurement project’s information architecture often overshadow technical necessities. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Information architecture necessities can include the creation of user profiles (personas of hypothetical system users), use cases (an analysis of the tasks those users might perform), and wireframes (the visual layout of the system&#8217;s interfaces).  Id." id="return-note-2020-25" href="#note-2020-25"><sup>25</sup></a>  Third, because software development regularly prioritizes designing ideal workflows and simplifying human interactions rather than embracing a formulaic science, such creative processes cannot easily be planned or predicted. <a class="simple-footnote" title="See Fowler, supra note 20." id="return-note-2020-26" href="#note-2020-26"><sup>26</sup></a>  In light of these industry trends, modern software development has recently embraced a more integrated practice known as agile software development. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Mark Lycett et al., Migrating Agile Methods to Standardized Development Practice, Computer, June 2003, at 79, 79." id="return-note-2020-27" href="#note-2020-27"><sup>27</sup></a>

  B. Agile Software Development Mitigates the Risk Inherent in Uncertainty by Approaching a Project as Multiple Independent Tasks
</h3>

Agile development adopts an incremental approach to software development, but it does not seek to build software systems in a sequential, step-wise manner.  Instead it recognizes the reality that a future system owner may be unable to gather all requirements up front. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Szalvay, supra note 6, at 2; Government Contracting for Software Development Course Manual 33 (1994) [hereinafter Course Manual]; Lan Cao & Balasubramaniam Ramesh, Agile Requirements Engineering Practices: An Empirical Study, IEEE Software, Jan./Feb. 2008, at 60, 64; Fowler, supra note 20 (noting engineers&#8217; &#8220;nature is to resist change.  The agile methods, however, welcome change&#8221;)." id="return-note-2020-28" href="#note-2020-28"><sup>28</sup></a>  Even if this were possible, those requirements likely would change over time to reflect shifting technological and organizational priorities. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Fowler, supra note 20." id="return-note-2020-29" href="#note-2020-29"><sup>29</sup></a>  Thus the project is broken down into several smaller components. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Szalvay, supra note 6, at 1-2; Cao & Ramesh, supra note 28, at 63." id="return-note-2020-30" href="#note-2020-30"><sup>30</sup></a>  Plans are continuously inspected and adapted to the empirical reality of the project through rapid prototyping. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Cao & Ramesh, supra note 28, at 63." id="return-note-2020-31" href="#note-2020-31"><sup>31</sup></a>  As a practice widely used in the private sector, empirically agile development delivers better performing projects on time and under budget. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Id.  Similarities can be drawn between modern software development and the Japanese auto industry forty years ago.  Beginning in the 1970s Japanese auto manufacturers began adopting lean manufacturing practices to develop new vehicles.

Inst. of Tech., Working Paper No. 3477-92, 1992).   Due to this refined approach&#8217;s reduced overhead, Japanese manufacturers were able to generate thirty percent more profit per vehicle than Chrysler, one-hundred percent more per vehicle than Ford, and two-hundred percent more per vehicle than General Motors.

  A. The Rigidity of the Waterfall Process Brings Several Advantages to Federal IT Procurement
</h3>

In both form and function, waterfall development mirrors current procurement models.  The first step requires that future system owners document their needs extensively, and such requirements are easily incorporated into a solicitation.  This up-front documentation allows agencies to safely budget funds and allows contracting officers (COs) to marry funds to specific, pre-defined contractual events.  “Phase gates” within the contract provide agencies objective standards to evaluate a project’s propensity for success and allow agencies to abandon projects in some instances when the prospect of successful delivery appears grim.  Within an agency, waterfall development requires COs to justify projects to stakeholders early in the development cycle, and this overall process has gained agencies’ tacit endorsement over the years. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Richard K.

</h3>

Despite its long-standing history, waterfall software development comes with shortcomings.  The outdated methodology assumes requirements can be predicted upfront.  As a result it fails to adequately respond to changing conditions and forces agencies to incur costs disproportionate to project returns.

  i. Both conceptually and practically, waterfall assumes that contracting agencies can accurately forecast a project’s requirements in advance
</h4>

Waterfall relies on two key assumptions: (A) That requirements are fully understood by both contractor and contracting agency, and (B) That requirements are unlikely to change. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Szalvay, supra note 6, at 1-3; Course Manual, supra note 28, at 33.  Such an approach makes sense when it is traced backed to its traditional roots.  Engineers building bridges rely on well-established laws of physics supported by the fundamentals of mathematics, two sciences that are rigidly defined and easily relied upon.  Software development, on the other hand, is not bound by the rules of the physical world.  Gravity, an assumed constant in engineering, has relatively little relevance to programming." id="return-note-2020-47" href="#note-2020-47"><sup>47</sup></a>  Yet due to the often-unique nature of government systems, software contractors typically face challenges to which they have never been exposed, rendering predicting of future needs an inherently futile task. <a class="simple-footnote" title="See Mark Leicester, Government Projects the Agile Way: Can It Be Done?, St. Services Commission (Apr. 16, 2009), http://www.ssc.govt.nz/blog/government-projects-agile-way-can-it-be-done." id="return-note-2020-48" href="#note-2020-48"><sup>48</sup></a>

The traditional procurement model, which leans heavily on waterfall’s central tenants, demands specificity in planning, funding, and acquisition, and requires the contractors and COs to attain a certain level of “predictive precision” simply not found in the ever-changing world of technology. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Modular Contracting White Paper, supra note 41, at 7; Cao & Ramesh, supra note 28, at 63.  See Further Details on Modular Contracting Left for Public Meeting&#8211;Proposed Rule Adds Little to Clinger-Cohen Act, 39 Gov&#8217;t Contractor ¶ 161, Apr. 2, 1997 [hereinafter Further Details]." id="return-note-2020-49" href="#note-2020-49"><sup>49</sup></a>  As such, by requiring that all specifications be outlined upfront, the current procurement model encourages agencies to attempt an inevitably unsuccessful endeavor and thereby increases project risk. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Modular Contracting White Paper, supra note 41, at 7 (noting that &#8220;forcing this rigidity into the systems development acquisition process – intending to minimize risks and mistakes – can actually exacerbate the same.&#8221;).  As FCC Geographic Information Officer Michael Byrne commented, &#8220;procurement is like a board game.  You are trying to move your pieces to the other side. This would be easy if you had no opponent.  When the other team begins moving forward there&#8217;s no way to . . . know how to optimally get to the other side, and waterfall software development expects just that.

The unrealistic premises of waterfall procurement create a snowball effect.  Because it is impossible for COs to resolve all unknowns at the onset of a procurement, they often err on the side of caution and compound errors by over-documenting requirements and making erroneous assumptions. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Sherman, supra note 15, at 210-11; Poppendieck, supra note 32, at 1, 5 (arguing &#8220;the more companies attempted to define the process of product development, the less the organization was able to carry out that process&#8221;)." id="return-note-2020-51" href="#note-2020-51"><sup>51</sup></a>  This risk is further exacerbated as a result of waterfall’s insistence on delaying testing until late in the development cycle, <a class="simple-footnote" title="Further Details, supra note 49." id="return-note-2020-52" href="#note-2020-52"><sup>52</sup></a> meaning mistakes often do not become apparent until corrections are cost-prohibitive. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Id." id="return-note-2020-53" href="#note-2020-53"><sup>53</sup></a>  Especially given the size of typical government procurements, “[t]rying to implement everything at once increases the risk of failure on a grand scale if the technology fails to work as expected or if the original idea was misconceived.” <a class="simple-footnote" title="Id.

Agile development mitigates many of the risks imposed on agencies by waterfall development. Agile represents an iterative approach to software development that prioritizes communication over documentation and that adapts to change rather than futilely attempting to predict it.  As a result, agile projects tend to be more efficient, less costly, and more predictable than their waterfall counterparts.

.To facilitate agile’s hallmark rapid delivery in place of time-consuming formal documentation and rigid structure, agile relies on extensive person-to-person communication and organic processes.  In simplest terms, agility is defined by a software team’s ability “to efficiently and effectively respond to and incorporate requirement changes during the project life cycle.” <a class="simple-footnote" title="Lee & Xia, supra note 11, at 90." id="return-note-2020-81" href="#note-2020-81"><sup>81</sup></a>  To achieve this goal agile focuses on collaboration rather than documentation.  Agile promotes frequent, continuous delivery of working software and embraces changing requirements through close collaboration, self-organizing and self-motivated teams, face-to-face communications, and in turn, continuous adaptation. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Id. at 89, 92." id="return-note-2020-82" href="#note-2020-82"><sup>82</sup></a>

In the context of large-scale government projects, agile can deliver systems sooner than its similarly sized waterfall counterparts. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Royce, supra note 19, at 4." id="return-note-2020-96" href="#note-2020-96"><sup>96</sup></a>  Agile software development is more efficient than traditional development methodologies for five key reasons:  First, agile allows development teams to begin work immediately, even before requirements are fully known, an impossibility under a waterfall contract; <a class="simple-footnote" title="Szalvay, supra note 6, at 8." id="return-note-2020-97" href="#note-2020-97"><sup>97</sup></a> second, whereas waterfall development uses multiple factors to prioritize tasks, agile focuses solely on maximizing business value, <a class="simple-footnote" title="Cao & Ramesh, supra note 28, at 64." id="return-note-2020-98" href="#note-2020-98"><sup>98</sup></a> and thus, high-priority goals are realized and delivered to the customer early on; <a class="simple-footnote" title="Id." id="return-note-2020-99" href="#note-2020-99"><sup>99</sup></a> third, because agile communicates concrete specifications via face-to-face discussions, rather than lofty goals through formal documentation, and because agile embraces a streamlined decision-making process, rather than a rigid hierarchical structure, development teams gain a better understanding of and produce products that better meet agency needs and requirements; <a class="simple-footnote" title="Id.; DoD Acquisition Report, supra note 1, at 53." id="return-note-2020-100" href="#note-2020-100"><sup>100</sup></a> fourth, agile promotes the end user’s involvement throughout the process and thus ensures early and constant validation of features, minimizing the need for costly and time-consuming pre-deployment changes; <a class="simple-footnote" title="Cao & Ramesh, supra note 28, at 65." id="return-note-2020-101" href="#note-2020-101"><sup>101</sup></a> finally, because agile’s continual validation model requires constant use of the procured system, users receive training and preparation to use the new system on day one. <a class="simple-footnote" title="DoD Acquisition Report, supra note 1, at 47-48." id="return-note-2020-102" href="#note-2020-102"><sup>102</sup></a>  For all of these reasons, agile is more likely to deliver projects on time.

<h4 id="agile-is-inherently-less-costly-than-waterfall" class="toc">
  iii. Agile is inherently less costly than waterfall
</h4>

Agile projects tend to be less costly overall for three primary reasons.**  **First, because COs do not have to spend extensive time pre-award defining project requirements, agile development inherently imposes a lesser administrative burden. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Cao & Ramesh, supra note 28, at 65." id="return-note-2020-103" href="#note-2020-103"><sup>103</sup></a>  Face-to-face communication may require less investment than extensive documentation, in so far as in-person communications facilitate prompt clarification of any discrepancies or misunderstandings.  Second, administrative costs are further reduced as the need to modify the original contract if requirements change is wholly eliminated. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Id." id="return-note-2020-104" href="#note-2020-104"><sup>104</sup></a>  Finally, once the agency has awarded the contract, because agile breaks the project into smaller, more approachable tasks, agile reduces cost and cycle time by better utilizing the contractor’s resources. <a class="simple-footnote" title="DoD Acquisition Report, supra note 1, at 53.  See Poppendieck, supra note 32, at 15." id="return-note-2020-105" href="#note-2020-105"><sup>105</sup></a>  As a result, agile more consistently delivers projects on or under budget more often than waterfall.

<h4 id="agile-is-predictable" class="toc">
  iv. Agile is predictable
</h4>

While at first glance agile may seem less predictable, decreasing the amount of speculation involved in decision making inherently increases the predictability of the final outcome. <a class="simple-footnote" title="See Poppendieck, supra note 32, at 3." id="return-note-2020-106" href="#note-2020-106"><sup>106</sup></a>  Unlike waterfall’s hands-off approach, small increments of constant feedback provide a safety net of predictability upon which the contracting agency can base its decisions. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Id.; DoD Acquisition Report, supra note 1, at 47-48, 53." id="return-note-2020-107" href="#note-2020-107"><sup>107</sup></a>

  C. Despite its Advantages, Agile Methodologies Present Contracting Officers With Several Key Challenges
</h3>

Agile’s define-as-you-go approach does not often lend itself to satisfying government documentation requirements.  Its lack of pre-award specificity makes costs difficult to estimate, and, when compared to waterfall, agile exposes the contracting agency to greater risk. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Chief among agile&#8217;s criticisms in the private sector may be that its emphasis on functional, rather than technical requirements often underserves the project&#8217;s non-functional goals.  Cao & Ramesh, supra note 28, at 64-65." id="return-note-2020-108" href="#note-2020-108"><sup>108</sup></a>

  i. Agile methods are not well suited to meet government documentation requirements
</h4>

Extensive government contracting documentation and reporting requirements impose the greatest barrier to the adoption of agile procurement in the U.S.**  **Traditional government contracting requires that project “artifacts” be generated at each step of the process to memorialize project activity. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Glen B. Alleman et al., Making Agile Development Work in A Government Contracting Environment, in  Conference Papers, Agile Dev.

  ii. Agile engenders a lack of specificity pre-award, rendering cost estimates difficult to calculate
</h4>

Agile does not require that potential systems outline technical specifications owners before contract award, potentially causing COs difficulty as they attempt to estimate project costs. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Cao & Ramesh, supra note 28, at 64-65." id="return-note-2020-112" href="#note-2020-112"><sup>112</sup></a>  Often, project timelines are at best only roughly defined, and project teams may change drastically as requirements change. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Id." id="return-note-2020-113" href="#note-2020-113"><sup>113</sup></a>

However, while it may allow for less specificity pre-award, agile constantly adapts to the actual needs of the project (rather than remaining true to initial projections). As a result, in the long run, agile provides more accurate cost metrics and greater budget fidelity overall.

Many IT contracting vehicles may exist in the context of any given project.  While price-directed bids, competitive negotiations, conceptual negotiated sourcing, engineering selection, and modular contracting may provide some promise, no existing contracting vehicle is fully compatible with agile methodologies.

<h4 id="price-directed-sealed-bid" class="toc">

For the Federal Government to become more agile, three distinct but parallel initiatives are necessary.  First, COs and technical representatives must be educated as to the best practices for implementing agile in government contracting.  Second, statutory requirements encouraging agencies into waterfall frameworks by demanding extensive requirements documentation pre-award should be avoided through alternative contracting vehicles.  Finally, even if permitted by law, proponents must garner significant top-down support from within their agencies for agile practices to be accepted.

Before federal IT procurement can embrace agile methodologies, best-practices education is required on two levels.  First, COs must learn best practices for agile contracting. Second, technical officers within the agency must learn best practices for agile project management in the government sector.****

<h4 id="cos-must-learn-best-practices-in-agile-contracting" class="toc">

Many COs may not know what agile development is, let alone that it is a potential contracting vehicle and how best to implement it.  The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) should oversee the joint efforts of the General Services Administration (GSA), the White House OMB, <a class="simple-footnote" title="Strengthening IT program management by exposing best practices and aligning IT procurement with innovation is a central tenet of the White House&#8217;s plan to reform federal IT.  Kundra, supra note 13, at 17 (noting &#8220;[t]he acquisition process can require program managers to specify the [G]overnment&#8217;s requirements up front, which can be years in advance of program initiation . . .

Alongside existing professional development efforts, contracting organization technical representatives must be trained in best practices for executing and managing development projects through an agile framework.  This may include formal workshops for employees; the recruitment of experienced, private sector project managers; or simply a push to increase awareness of agile methodology and educational resources already at agencies’ disposal.

Even if an agile-friendly contracts are prepared, executed, and overseen successfully, two statutory stumbling blocks may hinder agile’s adoption: (i) the solicitation and subsequent award of the contract; and (ii) the governance of the contract while it is in progress. <a class="simple-footnote" title="This holds true for both the FAR and DoD regulations.  DoD Acquisition Report, supra note 1, at 4." id="return-note-2020-153" href="#note-2020-153"><sup>153</sup></a>

The single largest statutory roadblock to agile-friendly contracts is the requirement for technical specifications prior to solicitation.  This requirement locks contracting agencies into a waterfall method post-award and is antithetical to agile methodologies.  To pursue an agile framework, agencies should establish functional rather than technical benchmarks, developing a framework that can be used to define the focus of each subsequent sprint.

Part 36 of the FAR provides a modified procedure for procuring architectural and engineering services. <a class="simple-footnote" title="FAR 36.601." id="return-note-2020-154" href="#note-2020-154"><sup>154</sup></a>  Such a procurement would follow a two-phase procedure.  In phase one competing firms would submit proposals including their technical approaches and technical qualifications, but these would not include detailed design information or cost or price information.  Agencies would then rank the top firms, which would be asked to submit detailed proposals before the winning firm was selected for a contract to be executed through the design-build framework. <a class="simple-footnote" title="FAR 36.602-1." id="return-note-2020-155" href="#note-2020-155"><sup>155</sup></a>

Under FAR 36.601(4)(a)(3), to be eligible for the architecture-engineering route, the acquisition must “logically or justifiably require performance by registered architects or engineers or their employees.” <a class="simple-footnote" title="FAR 36.601(4)(a)(3).  The U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics classifies the software engineering role as a subset of computer specialist, see http://www.bls.gov/soc/soc_structure_2010.pdf, while all other engineering disciplines are a subset of engineer, http://www.bls.gov/soc/soc_structure_2010.pdf.  Additionally, software engineers do not receive professional engineering licenses from the state.  If a state were to grant such a license, this would serve as an interesting test case." id="return-note-2020-156" href="#note-2020-156"><sup>156</sup></a>  Congress should expand the definition of this section to include computer and software engineers to allow IT procurement to follow this route.

  ii. Modular contracting, FAR Part 39
</h4>

FAR 39.103 allows agencies to break large acquisitions into several smaller acquisition increments. <a class="simple-footnote" title="FAR 39.103 (implementing the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-106)." id="return-note-2020-157" href="#note-2020-157"><sup>157</sup></a>  To aid in accounting, budgeting, and documentation, an agile procurement can be contracted as one overarching contract defining the scope of the work and outlining a schedule by which each sprint’s focus will be defined.  This large contract may incorporate smaller contracts for each subsequent sprint, if necessary, as part of a process wholly in line with the Government’s push toward system-oriented architectures.

  C. COs Lack Top-Down Support for IT Procurement Reform
</h3>

The above goals cannot be realized without significant top-down support from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, OMB, and Chief Technology Officers at each agency.  COs must be empowered to take risks with such an unconventional approach.  While top administration officials have made statements supporting an agile approach to IT procurement reform, such rhetoric remains noncommittal.  <span class="pullquote">Tangible, specific guidance from senior administration officials to agency CIOs and CFOs must occur in order for innovation to succeed</span>.

  VI. Conclusion
</h2>

The federal IT procurement system is outdated.  Projects are consistently delivered late, over-budget, and obsolete.  Much of this trend can be traced back to flawed legal frameworks that lock agencies and contractors into an outdated development model.  Through education, reform, and organization-wide support, federal agility can become a reality.  Any computer user knows that as systems age they begin to slow.  Today, the federal IT procurement system is running slowly, to the detriment of both agencies and the public, and it is long overdue for a system-wide upgrade.

      For example, an architect draws up blueprints for a house and hands them off to a contractor for construction.  Should the future homeowner decide after the fact that he wishes to deviate from his original plan, e.g., he prefers the kitchen be five feet wider, such a change would incur substantial time, labor, and material costs as floors are re-laid, pipes re-plumbed, and electrical outlets rewired accordingly. <a href="#return-note-2020-21">↩</a>

      A prime example of such a phenomenon is the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO).  In 1983 the PTO initiated a billion-dollar automation effort using waterfall.  At the time the PTO’s patent files contained some thirty-three million documents, supporting patents issued since 1790, and grew at the rate of approximately one million documents per year.  The goal was to have a fully deployed system by 1990, however by 1987, the PTO began to realize that the program was fatally behind schedule and switched to an agile approach.  Course Manual , <em>supra</em> note 28, at 66-67<strong>.  </strong>The PTO was able to successfully deploy its patent search system (CSIR) later that year, and by 1992 had a significant portion of its automation system integrated into its workflow. <span class="smallcaps">U.S. Gov’t Accountability Office, GAO/AIMD-93-15, Patent and Trademark Office: Key Processes For Managing Automated Patent Development Are Weak</span> 4 (1993). <a href="#return-note-2020-62">↩</a>

      <em>See generally</em> Szalvay, <em>supra</em> note 6, at 1.  The ability to adapt to change has implications beyond project efficiency as well.  Hackers, cyber terrorists, and other malcontents are not bound by the rigidity of waterfall and are often able to adapt more rapidly to government countermeasures than the Government can develop defenses.  <em>See</em> Federal Executive Roundtable, <em>supra </em>note 56.  Similarly, after spending nearly two years and 0 million dollars developing handheld computers for use in conjunction with the 2010 census, the U.S. Census Bureau was forced to drop its plans and revert to paper-based collection when it realized the waterfall approach it had adopted would not deliver a working system in time for the census data collection.  <span class="smallcaps">White House Forum</span>, <em>supra </em>note 5, at 5-6. <a href="#return-note-2020-63">↩</a>
