      <p>WordPress is <em><a href='http://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/'>different</a></em>. WordPress is about content. WordPress is about simplicity. Out of the box, it&#8217;s a clean, lean, and mean semantic publishing platform that makes broadcasting your ideas as effortless as possible.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Proven</strong> – WordPress powers <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/19/wordpress-now-powers-22-percent-of-new-active-websites-in-the-us/'>nearly a quarter</a> of new sites today, is the content management system (CMS) of choice for <a href='http://trends.builtwith.com/cms'>more than two thirds</a> of the top million sites making it the most popular on the web, and is trusted by content publishers both large and small including CNN and the NY Times. With more than <a href='http://en.wordpress.com/stats/'>50 million sites globally</a> and eight years of proven history, you know you&#8217;re getting the best software for the job.</li>

<li><strong>Ease of use</strong> – At the core of WordPress is a <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Screens'>dumb-simple interface</a> similar to the desktop publishing software you use today. With no coding experience or expert knowledge necessary, the learning curve is<a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_Posts'>often about as short as typing in your site&#8217;s URL and logging in</a>. In fact, most users are able to pick up the basics without any training at all. Interfaces are polished and easy to use, and are the result of years of refinement. It&#8217;s the power of a Microsoft Word with the intuitiveness of an iPhone.</li>

<li><strong>Built for Publishing</strong>- WordPress makes sharing content and attracting readers to your site a breeze. Whether pushing content to social networks, ensuring that your website is provided in the <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Search_Engine_Optimization_for_WordPress'>optimal format to appear at the top of search results</a> the moment you hit publish, or providing visitors the ability to <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Feeds'>subscribe to specific content sub-feeds</a> in their favorite feed reader (or even via e-mail), WordPress is not simply a website, but rather a content-publishing platform. With a single click, you have a powerful megaphone to broadcast your message to the world</li>

<li><strong>Community Support</strong> – WordPress is supported by a <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Contributing_to_WordPress'>vibrant community of users</a> who have already solved many of the toughest challenges to sharing information today. The latest version of WordPress has been download <a href='http://wordpress.org/download/counter/'>more than five million times</a> since it was release a month ago, and the prior version was downloaded more than 32 million times. With a library of <a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/'>more than 20,000 free, open-source plug-ins and themes</a> growing each day, and hundreds of core contributors each release cycle, the WordPress community is an ecosystem built around the platform&#8217;s viability and proven success.</li>
</ul><h2 id='content_is_king'>Content Is King</h2><ul>
<li><strong>Your Entire Workflow</strong> - Although it may sound a bit counter intuitive for some that saw the letters QWERTY together for the first time on an <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Selectric_typewriter'>IMB Selectric</a>, WordPress can actually take the place of your entire workflow from the initial draft to the time you hit publish – spelling, grammar, collaboration, and review – there&#8217;s no need for e-mails back-and-forth or expensive desktop software.</li>

<li><strong>Beyond Black and White</strong>- Everything that makes webpages feel rich – pictures, videos, music, documents – can feel right at home in WordPress. With a drag-and-drop <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Uploading_Files'>file uploader</a> that uses the latest technology to ensure your file efortlessly makes it to the web page every time, and a <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Media_Add_New_Screen'>media browser to help you store, organize and find the files</a> you&#8217;re looking for, WordPress hosts the files that make your pages pop.</li>

<li><strong>Distraction Free Writing</strong> - Between E-Mail, IMs, Texts, Tweets, and Status Updates, we have enough distractions as is today. Your publishing platform should not be one of them. While writing WordPress literally fades away letting you concentrate on your ideas themselves, not how you&#8217;re getting them out there.</li>

<li><strong>Never Lose a Word</strong> - WordPress <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Revision_Management#Autosaves'>automatically saves your work</a> as you type so you don&#8217;t have to worry if your computer crashes or you make a mistake. Want to go back to a previous version? Not a problem. Every time you hit save, <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Revision_Management'>WordPress creates a snapshot</a> that you can restore with a single click.</li>

<li><strong>Time Travel</strong> - Okay, not really, but it&#8217;s pretty close. WordPress lets you schedule posts for some time in the future or lets you backdate a post for some time in the past so that you can write when its convenient for you.</li>

<li><strong>Publish Anywhere</strong> - The internet&#8217;s every, so why shouldn&#8217;t your workflow be? WordPress has <a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/mobile/'>mobile applications</a> for Android, iOS, Blackberry, Nokia, Windows Phone 7, even WebOS. Wherever you are, control of your site is <em>literally</em> at your fingertips. Your phone not listed? No fret. You can even <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_to_your_blog_using_email'>post to your site by e-mail</a>.</li>
</ul><h2 id='a_supercharged_v8_under_the_hood'>A Supercharged V8 Under the Hood</h2><ul>
<li><strong>The Right Tuxedo for Any Content</strong> – Your content deserves the best. The site should conform to your content, not the other way around. WordPress comes with a <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes'>full theme system</a> which makes designing everything from the simplest site to the most complicated portal a piece of cake. Have a new design every day. Your ideas should look as good as what they say.</li>

<li><strong>Obsessively Organized</strong> - It doesn&#8217;t matter how much content you have, if your visitors can&#8217;t find it. WordPress organizes your content by day, by month, by year, by author, by category — any way you can describe it — and dynamically creates browsable archives so things always stay up to date.</li>

<li><strong>Killer Search Inside and Out</strong>- WordPress has killer search baked in. Every word you write is fully searchable through a single box at the top of each page and if your users choose to use an external search engine like Google, rest assured, WordPress will present your content in a way that all but ensures it makes it to the top of the results every time.</li>

<li><strong>Even the URLs are Beautiful</strong>- Ever go to a site and look up to the URL bar only to see a string of letter and number gobbledygook? WordPress realizes that websites are built for people, not computers. Every URL is <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks'>intuitively written for humans</a> and describes what your content says, not where it sits in a database.</li>

<li><strong>Typography Nerds Rejoice</strong> - To do it right, publishing on the web can be a pain without the right tools. Every time you hit publish <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/How_WordPress_Processes_Post_Content'>WordPress silently typesets each and every letter for seamless web production</a>. Where many other CMSs let the details fall by the wayside, WordPress uses the <a href='http://photomatt.net/tools/texturize'>Texturize</a> engine to intelligently converts web-unfriendly characters like quotes, apostrophes, ellipses, em and en dashes, multiplication symbols, and ampersands into typographically correct HTML entities.</li>

<li><strong>¡Bienvenidos a WordPress!</strong> - WordPress has been translated to more than <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_in_Your_Language'>60 different languages</a>, so however you say &#8220;publish&#8221;, you&#8217;ll be saying it in no time flat.</li>

<li><strong>Drag and Drop Administration</strong> - Weren&#8217;t a computer science major in college? No degree required, promise. Most of what users see from <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Appearance_Menus_Screen'>menus</a> to the <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Appearance_Widgets_Screen'>dynamic functionality on each page</a> can be fully customized with simple drag-and-drop controls on the back end.</li>

<li><strong>Multiple Personalities</strong> - Got a bunch of users? Not a problem. WordPress lets you <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities'>define different roles for different users</a> – just like in real life – and lets you assign privileges accordingly. Users can register themselves (if you want), and can submit content for your review.</li>
</ul><h2 id='user_tested_geek_approved'>User Tested, Geek Approved</h2><ul>
<li><strong>Out-of-the-box Power</strong> - WordPress provides extensive functionality right out-of-the-box and often little customization is needed to adapt the software for your unique use. Many other CMSs rely on you to hunt down, install, and configure a long-list of add-ons just to get many of the features WordPress considers core (comments, RSS feeds, revisions, etc.) and relies on developers to undertake significant coding efforts to provide the functionality you need. WordPress does the heavy lifting so you don&#8217;t have to. Why reinvent the wheel when you already have the best wheel in the world?</li>

<li><strong>Open and Transparent</strong>- WordPress is built by a dedicated community of professional developers, academics, and enthusiasts with the source code released to the world to take apart, build upon, and improve. It&#8217;s hallmark is a rapid development cycle, meaning frequent updates and always up-to-date software, all with no licensing fees or direct costs. And with an extensive international community professional support is always wherever you are.</li>

<li><strong>It&#8217;s Your Data</strong> - Some publishing platforms like to lock you in with proprietary data formats. Not here. WordPress relies on open standards to allow you to take your data with you, and even comes with tools to seamlessly import from many popular sources. It&#8217;s your data, and you should do what you want with it.</li>

<li><strong>It&#8217;s Your Software</strong> - WordPress is designed to be installed on your own web server, in the cloud, or in a shared hosting account. You have complete control. Unlike commercial software or third-party hosted services, you can be sure of being able to access and modify everything related to your site. You can even install WordPress on your personal computer, or on a corporate intranet.</li>

<li><strong>Power One Site or Millions</strong> - WordPress offers multi-site technology. It is the same technology that powers over 20 million sites on <a href='http://wordpress.com/'>WordPress</a><a href='http://wordpress.com/'>.</a><a href='http://wordpress.com/'>com</a> and global sites like CNN and the New York Times. Multi-site technology allows users to have full administrative control over their own site, without any security concerns. Each site can have its own look-and-feel (themes), its own functionality (plug-ins), and manage its own users, while at the same time, network-wide policies and security updates can be deployed at the click of a button.</li>
</ul><h2 id='your_cio_will_love_it'>Your CIO will Love it</h2><ul>
<li><strong>Your Site is Your Castle</strong>- WordPress has more than eight years of history powering stable, <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening_WordPress'>secure websites</a>. Vulnerabilities are discovered quickly because of the wide user-base and dedicated open-source community, patches are rapidly developed by the dedicated security team, and often released in the span of hours from the time they are reported. WordPress comes with an<a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Updating_WordPress#Automatic_Update'>integrated core-update system</a>, so patches are deployed at the click of a mouse. WordPress<a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Data_Validation'>sanitizes all user input</a>, restricts URL access, has an extensive user permissioning system, and never stores passwords in an unecryptable format. WordPress uses WordPress.com&#8217;s 20 million users to beta test releases before they come out, so that by the time new versions are released, stakeholders can be confident in their stability.</li>

<li><strong>Extensive APIs</strong> - WordPress&#8217;s core relies on its own<a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API'>extensive API interface</a> (commonly known as <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food'>dogfooding</a>) which consequently allows developers to quickly and effectively customize the application to their unique needs. Many aspects of the essential WordPress experience can be overridden or modified by user-generated <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference'>hooks and filters</a>. These APIs help WordPress integrate seamlessly with existing systems, a necessity in a stove-pipe rich environments.</li>

<li><strong>Enterprise Ready</strong> - Any challenge the agency faces, chances are, someone else has already tackled it and provided the code free of charge. WordPress has been adapted to countless enterprise environments, and provides support for Active Directory authentication, user management, work-flow integration, and scheduled backups, among other enterprise-centric features.</li>

<li><strong>Interoperability</strong> - Want to connect WordPress to another system? WordPress uses <a href='http://www.xmlrpc.com/'>XML-RPC</a>, an open XML standard that allows different systems in different environments to talk to one another. XML-RPC is designed to be as simple as possible, while at the same time allowing for complex tasks to be performed.</li>

<li><strong>Maintenance so simple you&#8217;ll wonder why you did it the other way</strong>- Installing and upgrading WordPress is a piece of cake. WordPress&#8217;s <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress#Famous_5-Minute_Install'>famous five minute install</a> is the envy of the industry, and with <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Dashboard_Updates_Screen'>one click updates</a>, you&#8217;ll know you always be using the best. Try it and you&#8217;ll wonder why all software isn&#8217;t this easy.</li>

<li><strong>Trust, but Verify</strong> - Not everyone is evil, but keep those who are in check by limiting which html tags are kosher on your weblog. The default html tags allowed by WordPress are a sane choice to let people use html in their comments and posts, without compromising the safety of your data or server.</li>

<li><strong>Standards Complaint… and then some</strong> - The WordPress team has gone to great lengths to ensure every bit of WordPress generated code is in full compliance with the standards of the <a href='http://w3.org/'>W3C</a>. This is important not only for interoperability with today&#8217;s browser but also for forward compatibility with the tools of the next generation. Your web site is a beautiful thing, and you should demand nothing less.</li>

<li><strong>More than a Blog… Much, Much More</strong>- Anyone who says WordPress is a mere blogging platform is covering for the fact that they haven&#8217;t been following the CMS&#8217;s explosive growth over the past couple years. Saying WordPress is only a blogging platform is like saying BMW is <a href='http://www.logoblog.org/bmw_logo.php'>only a propeller manufacturer</a>. In fact, the majority of the time, <a href='http://max.limpag.com/article/wordpress-open-source-cms-2011/'>WordPress isn&#8217;t even used as a blog</a>. With built in support for custom post types and custom taxonomies, if you can dream it, WordPress can make it a reality.</li>

      <blockquote>
<p>&#8220;In 1876, the president of Western Union brushed off Alexander Graham Bell&#8217;s telephone as little more than an &#8221;<em>electric toy</em>,&#8221; and the company called Bell&#8217;s proposal to put one in every home &#8221;<em>utterly out of the question</em>.&#8221; Oxford University professor Erasmus Wilson predicted that when the 1878 Paris Exhibition closed, the electric light would &#8221;<em>close with it and no more will be heard of it</em>.&#8221; A Michigan banker advised his client not to invest in Henry Ford&#8217;s company in 1903 because &#8221;<em>the horse is here to stay, but the automobile is only a novelty</em>.&#8221; …If there is one constant through out time, it&#8217;s that conventional wisdom often misses the mark, especially in the early days of technological transformation.&#8221; <sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve never heard any individual, upon being asked what they thought of a recent automobile purchase respond, &#8221;<em>well, it&#8217;s got this weird ‘new car&#8217; smell, so it&#8217;s going to take some getting used to</em>.&#8221; <sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup> Yet for many, such is the typical reaction to experiencing a new technology. <sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup></p><p>What is it about technological progress that sends many running for their digital security blankets? <sup id='fnref:4'><a href='#fn:4' rel='footnote'>4</a></sup> For some reason, much of the resistance appears to be <a href='http://opensource.sys-con.com/node/692407'>uniformed doubt</a> (<em>e.g.</em>, &#8220;It&#8217;s different&#8221;), rather than <a href='http://www.infoworld.com/d/security-central/gartner-seven-cloud-computing-security-risks-853'>calculated avoidance</a> (<em>e.g.</em>, &#8220;It&#8217;s less secure because you can&#8217;t prevent X&#8221;). To be fair, the business world, and even more so CIO&#8217;s, see avoiding uncertainty and minimizing risk as a core competency, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the whole story.</p><p>The rapid pace of innovation has rendered many stakeholders and decision makers out of the loop when it comes to where a given technology stands in relation to their current practices, and for good reason: disruptive technology poses a risk not only on a organization level, but on a personal level as well.</p><ul>
<li><strong>From a practical standpoint</strong>, all other things remaining constant, a firm&#8217;s move to the cloud, for example, <a href='http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/news/1381193/IT-job-security-fears-over-cloud-computing-Network-jobs-still-vital'>brings into question the security of the sysadmin</a> that has spent years building up a fiefdom of server farms.</li>

<li><strong>From a skills standpoint</strong>, there&#8217;s a whole generation out there that grew up on the Internet, and many of those in a position to make purchasing decisions or recommendation are simply not part of it. A young upstart consultant coming in and showing up the veteran can potentially be a recurring (and realistic) <a href='http://www.lexjansen.com/pharmasug/2000/techtech/tt16.pdf'>nightmare for many baby boomers</a>.</li>

<li><strong>From a professional standpoint</strong>, at its most basic level, risk is taken by individuals (who propose a new system, procedure, etc.), which in many organizations may have an incentive to adopt a &#8220;don&#8217;t rock the boat&#8221; mentality for their own career&#8217;s sake, rather than <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betamax'>risk being wrong</a>.</li>
</ul><p>If technological innovation were simply a matter of calculated risk and switching costs, one would expect firms to be <em>equally</em> as unlikely to upgrade an existing technology as they would be to switch to a new one. Mathematically, upgrading in-house servers to the next version of Microsoft Exchange may<a href='http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/messaging_value.html'>far outweigh</a> a move to the cloud. Yet, large firms have been <a href='http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2009/07/paving-road-to-apps-adoption-in-large.html'>slow to make the change</a>.</p><p>There&#8217;s a whole world out there of distributed, open innovation that, with the exception of a few startups, <sup id='fnref:5'><a href='#fn:5' rel='footnote'>5</a></sup> has been widely ignored by IT departments, and as Yochai Benkler argues in <em><a href='http://www.amazon.com/Wealth-Networks-Production-Transforms-Markets/dp/0300110561'>The Wealth of Networks</a>,</em> if history suggests anything, it is that the proprietary model is on its way to the endangered species list.</p><p>So what&#8217;s the answer? How can open source fanatics and other early adopters rescue the change averse from their self-perpetuated anachronisms?</p><ul>
<li><strong>Talk about <em>solutions</em> not technology</strong> – Geeks love shiny new things. It&#8217;s in our DNA. Yet rarely are geeks the one making the decisions. Decision makers could often care less which acronym powers something, but rather than dumb things down (&#8220;this thingy talks to that thingy&#8221;), translate the situation in terms of <a href='http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newPPM_82.htm'>organizational change</a> (&#8220;it will wholly eliminate the need for paper forms&#8221;). Rarely does technology change without the organization following suit. <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Solution-Selling-Creating-Difficult-Markets/dp/0786303158'>Approach the situation as a human problem</a>, not a technical one.</li>

<li><strong>Move past &#8221;</strong><strong><em>If it ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it&#8221;** – &#8221;<em>It&#8217;s good enough&#8221; should never be a persuasive argument for stagnation. Just because something has been used in the past, does not mean that it should. <sup id='fnref:6'><a href='#fn:6' rel='footnote'>6</a></sup> &lt;/em&gt;In software development, changes fit into one of two categories: bugs and enhancements. Saying that something &#8220;works&#8221; ignores exactly half of the equation.</em></em></strong></li>

<li><strong>Broadcast excellence</strong>- If you ask me why an organization should use SharePoint, I have at my fingertips <a href='http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/product/benefits/Pages/default.aspx'>focus-group tested ammunition</a>. Ask my why you should use WordPress, and I&#8217;m <a href='https://encrypted.google.com/webhp?oei=4HNeTqaVEsb50gGCldE7#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;newwindow=1&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=hp&amp;q=Why+Wordpress%3F+site%3Awordpress.org&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=Why+Wordpress%3F+site:wordpress.org&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=3748l3748l0l4002l1l1l0l0l0l0l128l128l0.1l1l0&amp;qscrl=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;fp=4bf87fb63526ad5b&amp;biw=1123&amp;bih=733'>left to pretty much fend for myself</a>.

    <div class="entrybody">
      <p><a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-document-revisions/'>WP Document Revisions</a> is a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_management_system'>document management</a> and <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control'>version control</a> plugin. Built for time-sensitive and mission-critical projects, teams can collaboratively edit files of any format — text documents, spreadsheets, images, sheet music… anything — all the while, seamlessly tracking the document&#8217;s progress as it moves through your organization&#8217;s existing workflow.</p><p><strong>WP Document Revisions is three things:</strong></p><ol>
<li><a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/04/04/when-all-you-have-is-a-pair-of-bolt-cutters/'><img alt='' src='http://ben.balter.com/2011/04/04/when-all-you-have-is-a-pair-of-bolt-cutters/' /></a>A <strong>document management system</strong> (DMS), to track, store, and organize files of any format</li>

<li>A <strong>collaboration tool</strong> to empower teams to collaboratively draft, edit, and refine documents</li>

<li>A <strong>file hosting solution</strong> to publish and securely deliver files to a team, to clients, or to the public</li>
</ol><p><strong>Powerful Collaboration Tools</strong> - <em>With great power does not have to come great complexity.</em> Based on a simple philosophy of putting powerful but intuitive tools in the hands of managers and content creators, WP Document Revisions leverages many of the essential WordPress features that, for more than eight years, have been tested and proven across countless industries — posts, attachments, revisions, taxonomies, authentication, and permalinks — to make collaborating on the creation and publication of documents a natural endeavor. Think of it as an <a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/04/04/when-all-you-have-is-a-pair-of-bolt-cutters/'>open-source and more intuitive version</a> of the popular Microsoft collaboration suite, <a href='http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx'>Sharepoint.</a></p><p><strong>Document History</strong> - At each step of the authoring process, WP Document Revisions gives you an instant snapshot of your team&#8217;s progress and the document&#8217;s history. It even gives you the option to revert back to a previous revision — so don&#8217;t fret if you make a mistake — or receive updates on changes to the document right in your favorite feed reader.</p><p><strong>Access Control</strong> - Each document is given a persistent URL (e.g., yourcompany.com/documents/2011/08/TPS-Report.doc) which can be private (securely delivered only to members of your organization), password protected (available only to those you select such as clients or contractors), or public (published and hosted for the world to see). If you catch a typo and upload a new version, that URL will continue to point to the latest version, regardless of how many changes you make.</p><p><strong>Enterprise Security</strong> - Worried about storing propriety or sensitive information? WP Document Revisions was built from the first line of code with government- and enterprise-grade security in mind. Each file is masked behind an anonymous 128-bit <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5'>MD5 hash</a> as soon as it touches the server, and requests for files are transparently routed through WordPress&#8217;s time-tested URL rewriting, authentication, and permission systems (which can even <a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/active-directory-integration/'>integrate with existing enterprise active directory</a> or <a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-ldap-login/'>LDAP servers</a>). Need more security? WP Document Revisions allows you to store documents in a folder above the <code>htdocs</code> or <code>public_html</code> <a href='http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#documentroot'>web root</a>, further ensuring that only those you authorize have access to your work.</p><p><strong>Customization</strong> - WP Document Revisions recognizes that no two teams are identical, and as a result, molds to your firm&#8217;s needs, not the other way around. Need to track additional information associated with a document? Departments, editors, issues, sections, even arbitrary key-value pairs – whatever you can throw at it, it can handle. Development and customization costs are further minimized by its extensive plugin API, and the <a href='http://themergency.com/generators/wordpress-custom-taxonomy/'>WordPress Custom Taxonomy Generator</a> makes it easy for even the uninitiated to add custom taxonomies to documents. Need an audit trail to track check-ins and check-outs? User-level permissions based on the document&#8217;s state or another custom taxonomy? Support for third-party encryption? Check out the <a href='https://github.com/benbalter/WP-Document-Revisions-Code-Cookbook'>WP Document Revisions Code Cookbook</a> for sample code. Looking for even more advanced control of your workflow? WP Document Revisions will detect the popular workflow plugin <a href='http://editflow.org/'>Edit Flow</a>, if installed, and will automatically pull <a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/10/24/advanced-workflow-management-tools-for-wp-document-revisions/'>Edit Flow&#8217;s advanced workflow management tools</a> into WP Document Revisions. Simply put, virtually every aspect of the plugin&#8217;s functionality from workflow states to user-level permissions can be fully customized to your team&#8217;s unique needs.</p><p><strong>Future Proof</strong> - Switching costs a concern? WP Document Revisions is built with tomorrow&#8217;s uncertainty in mind. Equally at home in an in-house server room as it is in the cloud, moving individual files or entire document repositories in and out of WP Document Revisions is a breeze (history and all). And since the software is open-source, you can easily add tools to automate the process of moving to or integrating with future third-party systems.</p><p><strong>The Vitals:</strong></p><ul>
<li>Support for any file type (docs, spreadsheets, images, PDFs — anything!)</li>

<li>Securely stores unlimited revisions of your business&#8217;s essential files</li>

<li>Provides a full file history in the form of a revision log, accessible via RSS</li>

<li>Helps you track and organize documents as they move through your organization&#8217;s existing workflow</li>

<li>Each file gets a permanent, authenticated URL that always points to the latest version</li>

<li>Each revision gets its own unique url (e.g.,TPS-Report-revision-3.doc) accessible only to those you deem</li>

<li>Files are intuitively checked out and locked to prevent revisions from colliding</li>

<li>Toggle documents between public, private, and password protected with a single mouse click</li>

<li>Runs in-house or in the cloud</li>

<li>Secure: filenames are hashed on upload and files are only accessible through WordPress&#8217;s proven authentication system</li>

<li>Can move document upload folder to location outside of web root to further ensure government- and enterprise-grade security</li>

<li>Documents and Revisions shortcodes, Recently Revised Documents widget</li>

<li>Multisite and Windows (XAMPP) support</li>

<li>French and Spanish language support (easily translated to your language)</li>

<li>Integration with <a href='http://editflow.org/'>Edit Flow</a></li>
</ul><p><strong>Features Available via the <a href='https://github.com/benbalter/WP-Document-Revisions-Code-Cookbook'>Code Cookbook</a>:</strong></p><ul>

      <p>Google recently added <a href='http://mashable.com/2011/06/30/google-analytics-social-plugin/'>social engagement tracking</a> to its analytics suite. With a little bit of leg work, Google Analytics can track not only +1s, but also Facebook and Twitter shares via a simple <code>_gaq.push</code> call.</p><p>If your site uses WordPress&#8217;s JetPack plugin with Sharedaddy, and you already have <a href='http://yoast.com/wordpress/google-analytics/'>Google Analytics</a> up and running, you can use jQuery to attach the virtual event to the share button.</p><p>To add Google Analytics to Sharedaddy&#8217;s Twitter share button:</p><pre><code>$(&#39;a.share-twitter&#39;).click( function() {
_gaq.push( [&#39;_trackSocial&#39;, &#39;twitter&#39;, &#39;share&#39;,
$(this).attr(&#39;href&#39;).substr(0, $(this).attr(&#39;href&#39;).indexOf(&#39;?&#39;))]);
});</code></pre><p>…and for Facebook:</p><pre><code>$(&#39;a.share-facebook&#39;).click( function() {
_gaq.push( [&#39;_trackSocial&#39;, &#39;faceboook&#39;, &#39;share&#39;,
$(this).attr(&#39;href&#39;).substr(0, $(this).attr(&#39;href&#39;).indexOf(&#39;?&#39;))]);
});</code></pre><p>The above code simply listens for the share button to be clicked, and if so, passes the target URL back to Google, along with the service&#8217;s name. Putting it all together into a plugin with a hook to <code>&lt;del&gt;wp_head&lt;/del&gt; wp_footer</code> you get:</p><pre><code>&amp;lt;?php
/**
 * Plugin Name: Jetpack (Sharedaddy) Google Analytics Tracking
 * Description: Allows tracking of Facebook and Twitter shares in Google Analytics Social Tracking
 * Author: Benjamin J. Balter
 * Author URI:  http://ben.balter.com
 * Version: 0.1
 */

 /**
  * Outputs javascript to document footer
  */
function bb_ga_social_footer() { ?&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;
	jQuery(document).ready(function($) {

		//twitter

		$(this).attr(&#39;href&#39;).substr(0, 	$(this).attr(&#39;href&#39;).indexOf(&#39;?&#39;))]);
		});

		//facebook
		$(&#39;a.share-facebook&#39;).click( function() {
		_gaq.push( [&#39;_trackSocial&#39;, &#39;faceboook&#39;, &#39;share&#39;,
		$(this).attr(&#39;href&#39;).substr(0, $(this).attr(&#39;href&#39;).indexOf(&#39;?&#39;))]);
		});

	});
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;?php }

//add our hook with higher-than-default priority
add_action(&#39;wp_footer&#39;, &#39;bb_ga_social_footer&#39;, 20)

/**

function bb_ga_social_enqueue() {
	wp_enqueue_script(&amp;quot;jquery&amp;quot;);
}

//add hook to enqueue jQuery on load
add_action(&#39;init&#39;, &#39;bb_ga_social_enqueue&#39;);
?&amp;gt;</code></pre><p>The code should work out of the box with the standard share buttons (seen below), but can easily be adapted with a few minor modifications to apply to like and other iterations of the social media icons.</p><p>More details on the tracking code can be found over in the <a href='http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/tracking/gaTrackingSocial.html'>Google Analytics Social Engagement Documentation</a>. Improve the code to work with your site? Feel free to <a href='https://gist.github.com/1058469'>fork the gist</a> and contribute it back.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> Dedicated reader All-around rabble-rouser <a href='http://andrewnacin.com'>Andrew Nacin</a> points out that by default, jQuery is queued up into the footer. Updated the above code to hook into <code>wp_footer</code> with a priority of 20 (higher than jQuery&#8217;s 10 hook).</p><p><strong>Update:</strong>Special thanks to <a href='http://twitter.com/Ramoonus'>@Ramoonus</a> for <a href='https://gist.github.com/1058469/db96b6836f279811205bddbf8be67bec6ca2159c'>didn&#8217;t queue up jQuery</a>.</p>

	<div class="post-meta">
		<span class="entry-date">Posted on June 16, 2011</span>

    <div class="entrybody">
      <p><img alt='' src='http://ben.balter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/5554901181_664eac93a6_b-300x200.jpg' />Despite the hype, daily deal sites like Groupon and LivingSocial are not the next wave of e-commerce. Not only are they bad for merchants, their business model simply isn&#8217;t sustainable as established firms begin to enter the already-crowded market.</p><p>***<strong><em>Bad for Business</em></strong>***</p><p>It&#8217;s hard for small businesses to profit from the deal. Sure, a daily deal will drive additional bodies through the door, but like many promotions, business often lose money on the deal itself, especially once Groupon or LivingSocial&#8217;s cut is factored in, a cut which can often be as high as 50%. The key, it seems, for small business, is <a href='http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2654788'>to be smart</a>, either upselling the customer, or convincing them that a second, non-discounted visit is well worth their while — not a simple task for the uninitiated.</p><p>Although Groupon&#8217;s compulsory non-disclosure agreement renders the majority of the evidence anecdotal at best, part of the problem seems to stem from a misalignment between the deal sites&#8217; interests and businesses&#8217;, despite what seems like a standard revenue sharing model. Deals are <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/09/groupon-single-worst-decision/'>scheduled to optimize the deal site&#8217;s profit</a>, not the merchant&#8217;s and the unexpected influx of new customers <a href='http://gawker.com/5786492/the-groupon-backlash-its-the-business-model-stupid'>can prove disasterous</a> if not properly managed. For a local business, an injection of constantly-connected 20-somethings can be fatal to the business&#8217;s online reputation if experience does not live up to the deal site&#8217;s <a href='http://gawker.com/5785317/the-groupon-backlash-is-on'>well-crafted hipster-sweatshop hype</a>.</p><p><strong>Legal Pitfalls</strong></p><p>The economics of the situation are only half the threat. Daily deals live in murky legal waters, and the sites often push small business into the deep end, rather than provide the necessary guidance. Basic economies of scale dictate that it would be significantly more efficient for Groupon or LivingSocial to establish a firm policy around the relevant legal issues (<em>e.g.,</em> &#8220;we do not offer discounts on alcohol in Chicago&#8221;), rather than require each small business to incur what most likely amounts to a relatively large expense (not to mention legal risk), effort duplicated across merchants and states.</p><p>As Benjamin Edelman and Paul Kominers <a href='http://www.benedelman.org/voucher-consumer-protection/#liability'>argue</a>:</p><p><span>T</span>he legal and regulatory questions… are questions that arise distinctively in the context of discount vouchers: a merchant would never confront such questions were it not for discount vouchers. Having created the transactions giving rise to this regulatory complexity… discount voucher services should be expected to achieve compliance.</p><p>Edelman and Kominers <a href='http://www.benedelman.org/voucher-consumer-protection/#liability'>continue</a>:</p><p>Voucher services typically seek to cast themselves as mere marketing vendors that are not responsible for the conduct of the corresponding merchants. For example, <a href='http://www.groupon.com/terms'>Groupon&#8217;s Terms of Sale</a> claim that &#8220;The Merchant, not Groupon, is the seller of the Voucher and the goods and services and is solely responsible for redeeming any Voucher you purchase.&#8221;</p><p>…But a voucher service is the merchant of record for the charge to the customer&#8217;s credit card. As the entity officially responsible for charging the consumer, the voucher service thus faces increased responsibility to see that the consumer receives what was promised.</p><p>This, combined with the fact that <a href='http://www.businessinsider.com/teardown-of-the-groupon-merchant-agreement-2011-6'>Groupon claims the entirety of the purchase price as revenue</a> suggests that daily deal sites are the 10,000 lb guerilla unfairly shifting the legal burden to small businesses. Despite all this, Groupon&#8217;s largest shareholder simply <a href='http://blogs.forbes.com/luisakroll/2011/04/04/new-billionaire-eric-lefkofsky-talks-about-groupon-and-tech-investing/'>recommends</a> that business not &#8220;worry about the noise that the legal system creates.&#8221;</p><p><strong>Gift Cards?</strong> First is the question of if a daily deal constitutes a <a href='http://www.ncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid=12474'>gift card</a>, a legal issue with which both <a href='http://www.jpml.uscourts.gov/Panel_Orders/MDL-2238-Initial_Transfer.pdf'>Groupon</a> and <a href='http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Seattle-class-action-LivingSocial-expiration-1015493.php'>LivingSocial</a> are intimately familiar with, defending at least <a href='http://www.benedelman.org/voucher-consumer-protection/#expiration'>12 distinct lawsuits</a>. Despite the expiration date listed online, in print, and often sent in reminder e-mails, in some states, customers may be eligible to redeem deals long after they expire, or at least have ground to reclaim their initial investment, often at the merchants&#8217; expense.</p><p><strong>Sales Tax</strong> Second is the question of what the sales tax should be levied at the time the goods or services are actually tendered. As TechCrunch aptly <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/15/daily-deal-consumer-protection-laws/'>points out</a> there&#8217;s a great deal of leeway depending on how you crunch the numbers:</p><p>What&#8217;s the correct sales tax on a $51 purchase with a $50 Groupon that someone bought for $25 in a state with a 5% tax rate? The possible answers are 5 cents, 68 cents, $1.30 and $2.55. That&#8217;s based on a taxable value of $1 (amount paid at point of sale), $13.50 (amount merchant actually gets), $26 (total amount consumer paid) and $51 (total face value of the transaction).</p><p><strong>Alcohol</strong> Third, daily deals involving alcohol, may <a href='http://www.tabc.state.tx.us/education/pdfs/Happy-Hour-Laws.pdf'>run afoul of the law in certain states</a>. In Illinois, Groupon&#8217;s home state, for example, it is illegal to offer alcohol discounts to some patriots and not others. Researchers found <a href='http://www.benedelman.org/voucher-consumer-protection/beer-chicago-google-060811.png'>87 deals</a> in Chicago alone that advertised discounts on beer, and <a href='http://www.benedelman.org/voucher-consumer-protection/wine-chicago-google-060811.png'>another 252</a> that offered discounts on wine.</p><p><strong>What&#8217;s Next for Groupon</strong></p><p>Not much. Assuming Groupon scales back its cut and guides merchants through the industry&#8217;s legal pitfalls, as Groupon&#8217;s <a href='http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490281/000104746911005613/a2203913zs-1.htm'>recent S-1</a> shows, they are still <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/13/why-groupon-is-poised-for-collapse/'>using the revenue from new deals to pay for previous ones</a>, generally repaying merchants over the course of two months. If Google&#8217;s Offers service gains traction, Groupon could face some serious operating cash flow issues, especially with the competition paying out <a href='http://www.google.com/support/offersbusiness/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1229917'>80% within four days</a>.</p><p><strong>Limited Growth</strong>Daily deal sites&#8217; most successful contribution to the market are not the deals themselves, but rather the hype ecosystem they generate. Like any viral network, their model is dependent on friends continuously asking friends &#8220;oh, have you heard of this cool new thing the kids are doing.&#8221; With the early adopting Facebook generation arguably tapped, it&#8217;s only a matter of time before baby boomers become equally saturated.</p><p>Sure it&#8217;s fun to get an e-mail in your inbox with a &#8220;super-exclusive&#8221; offer, but when everyone&#8217;s in on it, the artificial scarcity is no longer all that alluring. How many nearly identical offers for half off yoga can one person get before they get tired of misses and simply unsubscribe. Multiply that threat by the increasing number of daily deal sites that are springing up and the problem becomes readily apparent.</p><p><strong>Data Blindspot</strong>Smart websites are driven by data — personal data — and they use it to fuel growth. Amazon leverages my buying history to make personalized recommendations and I buy more stuff. Facebook maps out my social graph and recommends people I know and I friend more people. Netflix tracks my viewing history, going so far as to put a up a <a href='http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/21/netflix-awards-1-million-prize-and-starts-a-new-contest/'>$1 million bounty</a> to perfect reading my mind. And daily deal sites know that&#8217;s their <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/11/why-we-invested-in-groupon-the-power-of-data/'>only shot at staying relevant</a>.</p><p>Despite <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/07/groupon-everywhere-jiwire/'>Groupon&#8217;s efforts</a>, there&#8217;s just not enough data there. They may have my age, gender, rough location, and one or two datapoints of buying history, but compare that to the relative dossier that Google and Amazon both have to have on me, it&#8217;s always going to be a losing fight. Once first mover advantage begins to lose its shimmer, the big boys&#8217; synergies will begin to show their <a href='http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/04/facebook-deals/'>true</a> <a href='http://thenextweb.com/us/2011/06/02/amazon-enters-the-daily-deals-space-with-amazonlocal/'>potential</a>, and daily deal sites like Groupon and LivingSocial will expire as quickly as the deals they peddle.</p><p><span>Photo courtesy <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/wovox/5554901181/'>wovox</a></span></p>

      <p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_hosting_service'><img alt='' src='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_hosting_service' /></a>Bluehost, the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_hosting_service'>web hosting service</a> which powers more than <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluehost'>1.9 million</a> websites globally, making it one of the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluehost'>top 20</a> largest hosting companies in the world and approximately <a href='http://www.necn.com/01/05/11/Koch-Industries-sues-over-bogus-website-/landing_scitech.html?&amp;blockID=3&amp;apID=b76a38541f994e489206850f0db50d02'>2% of the internet&#8217;s traffic</a>, recently came under fire for its decision to depart from well-established <a href='http://pubcit.typepad.com/clpblog/2010/07/two-new-cases-on-internet-anonymity.html'>internet standards</a> and reveal the identity of one of its subscribers, over what <a href='http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/money/51780456-79/koch-company-judge-federal.html.csp'>later proved</a> to be an <a href='http://pubcit.typepad.com/files/kochindustries.pdf'>unfounded suit</a>.</p><p>From a technical standpoint, Bluehost is one of the good guys. I&#8217;ve hosted sites with them since 2005 and looking back at the past six months, I&#8217;ve enjoyed a 99.79% uptime, with an average response time just under a second. But that&#8217;s half the equation. Web hosting is not simply a cost-benefit analysis of price to uptime and responsiveness. There&#8217;s a third factor there: trust.</p><p>Why does a hosting company require trust? In December, a <a href='http://www.scribd.com/doc/45044630/Koch-Industries-on-Climate-Science'>fake news release</a> was <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/14/business/media/14link.html?_r=1'>published</a> on a Bluehost powered site by an anonymous satirical group, stating that after &#8220;a recent internal and thorough company review,&#8221; Koch Industries, an oil processing company, would be &#8220;restructuring its support of climate change research and advocacy initiatives.&#8221;</p><p>The problem occurred, however, when Bluehost was over eager to comply with Koch&#8217;s subpoena demanding the identity of the anonymous poster, <a href='http://www.necn.com/01/05/11/Koch-Industries-sues-over-bogus-website-/landing_scitech.html?&amp;blockID=3&amp;apID=b76a38541f994e489206850f0db50d02'>arguing</a>, &#8221;<span>w</span>e are not in the business of harboring, you know, felons and crooks. We are not about that. This isn&#8217;t WikiLeaks… <span>w</span>e comply with the law here.&#8221;</p><p>Bluehost knew that the customer wanted to be anonymous (they had opted into Bluehost&#8217;s domain protection program), however, the law here depends on Bluehost providing their client with knowledge of the subpoena, so that a timely objection can be heard by the issuing judge. In the <a href='http://pubcit.typepad.com/clpblog/2011/05/federal-court-dismisses-koch-brothers-trademark-suit-over-climate-change-prank.html'>words of the site&#8217;s own counsel</a>:</p><p>The judge ruled that <span>Bluehost&#8217;s customer,</span> Youth for Climate Truth had a First Amendment right to issue a satirical press release and website – in which the group impersonated Koch and announced that the company had reversed its position on climate change – in an effort to call attention to Koch&#8217;s <a href='http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/campaigns/global-warming-and-energy/polluterwatch/koch-industries/'>notorious bankrolling of efforts to deny climate change</a>.</p><p>The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah rejected all of Koch&#8217;s legal claims, which alleged trademark infringement, unfair competition, cybersquatting, computer hacking and breach of the company website&#8217;s terms of use. The judge also issued an order barring Koch from using any identifying information it had already obtained about our clients via subpoena.</p><p>The problem here arises not from Koch trying to use its legal muscle to silence political satire, but from Bluehost&#8217;s over willingness to comply with a request to identify the anonymous satirist.</p><p>In Bluehost&#8217;s defense, the suit came at the height of the WIkileaks debacle, a time when the industry&#8217;s top names were <a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/01/11/twitter-goes-to-bat-for-wikileaks/'>identifying otherwise anonymous customers</a>, but at the same time, as political interactions move increasingly online, our marketplace of ideas relies increasingly on hosting companies and internet services providers to remain good political citizens (not simply corporate ones).</p><p>While technology may lend voice to otherwise marginalized political groups, it does not come without risk. In a shared hosting environment like Bluehost, &#8220;your&#8221; website, is not necessarily &#8220;your&#8221; website. Will we begin to see subpoena response times along the list of benchmarks and features when evaluating hosting companies? Probably not. But if you are planning on leveraging shared servers — be they Bluehost, Twitter, or YouTube — to blog about anything more than say, <a href='http://dcinterns.blogspot.com/'>DC Summer Interns</a>, perhaps you should take a look at your hosting company&#8217;s legal record before you click submit.</p><p><span />: http://www.flickr.com/photos/timsamoff/391427627/</p>

</a></h2> 

	<div class="post-meta">
		<span class="entry-date">Posted on April 27, 2011</span> 
		<span class="entry-author">by Benjamin J. Balter</span>
	</div>
	    
    <div class="entrybody">
      <p><img alt='' src='http://ben.balter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/2146845610_ebd95e5f4e_b-300x200.jpg' />The Internet&#8217;s <em>laissez-faire</em> Internet ecosystem of liberal excerpting is often at odds with both <a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/31/AR2009073102476.html'>traditional</a> <a href='http://www.niemanlab.org/2009/08/gawker-and-the-washington-post-a-case-study-in-fair-use/'>media</a> and <a href='http://ilt.eff.org/index.php/Copyright:_Fair_Use'>the law</a>, but the bigger concerns for aspiring bloggers should be contributing to an ongoing dialog, rather than muddling it.</p><p>I was recently asked by an aspiring &#8220;content producer,&#8221; what the &#8220;rules&#8221; were for copying or excerpting content from other sites. From their questions, it quickly became clear to me, that they were missing the point of having a website altogether. <sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup></p><p>Not getting in hot water with <a href='http://www.hulu.com/watch/13576/hot-fuzz-chase'>the fuzz</a> is important, but it is simply one checkbox among many, relegated to the same category of subdued importance as spelling or grammar. The predominant rule in online publishing should not be fair use or copyright, but rather whether the author is adding value to the blogosphere. True, space on the Internet may be relatively cheap, but your reader&#8217;s time is not.</p><p>It seems Internet copyright law has become somewhat of a digital <a href='http://redvsblue.com/archive/episode.php?id=89'>Chupacabra</a> — the subject of endless urban legend and fact-less speculation. Despite <a href='http://www.llrx.com/features/bloggersbeware.htm'>widespread misunderstanding</a>, in practice, both the contours of fair use law and the cultural norms of the net lay clear guidelines for bloggers and content producers. Put another way, <em>the law&#8217;s the easy part</em>. Worry about the content and the law will take care of itself.</p><h3 id='the_culture'>The Culture</h3><p>Much like its roots in academia, the cornerstone of the Internet is the ability to contribute to an ongoing dialog by building on the ideas of others. With few exceptions, if your use of another&#8217;s work does not <em>add value</em>to the discussion, you may be fine legally, but practically, you&#8217;re just wasting space on the Internet. Criticism, commentary, and the synthesis of ideas not only enjoy fair use protections, but more importantly, give visitors a reason to read your content, drives traffic to your site, and justifies its existence. Likewise, facts and ideas are usually fair game, as are promotional materials and logos if you are discussing a specific company or product, but the reason for such an exception is not to give bloggers fodder for an easy blog post, but rather the exception is designed as a stimulus package for the marketplace of ideas.</p><p>The culture of the internet is not that it&#8217;s okay to <em>copy</em> others, but that it&#8217;s okay to <em>criticize</em> others, and if in doing so you quote or reference their work, that&#8217;s considered okay. So if you have something to say, where exactly does the law draw the line? <sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup></p><h3 id='is_it_copyrighted'>Is it copyrighted?</h3><p>If a work is no longer subject to copyright claims (and thus falls in the <a href='http://www.law.duke.edu/cspd/comics/zoomcomic.html'>public domain</a>), the discussion of fair use becomes a moot point. Such a determination does not, strictly speaking turn on the inclusion of the copyright symbol. <sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup> Instead, a work is <a href='http://www.unc.edu/~unclng/public-d.htm'>in the public domain</a> if it was created:</p><ul>
<li>by the federal government, at any time,</li>

<li>between 1964-1977 without a copyright notice.</li>

<li>between 1923-1963 with a copyright notice, if the copyright was not renewed,</li>

<li>between 1923-1963 without a copyright notice, or</li>

<li>before 1923.</li>
</ul><h3 id='is_it_fair_use'>Is it fair use?</h3><p>Even if a work merits copyright protection, it can still be used in many cases. The concept of <em>fair use</em> came about in late 1970′s following the Copyright Act of 1976. <sup id='fnref:4'><a href='#fn:4' rel='footnote'>4</a></sup> Simply put, the Copyright act states, &#8221;<em>purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.</em>&#8221; While there is no cut-and-dry rule as to when use infringes on the author&#8217;s copyright, the determination as to whether a given excerpt constitute fair uses is governed by four-factor <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balancing_test'>balancing test</a>: <sup id='fnref:5'><a href='#fn:5' rel='footnote'>5</a></sup></p><ol>
<li>the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;</li>

<li>the nature of the copyrighted work;</li>

<li>the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and</li>

<li>the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.</li>
</ol><p>Some factors that may tip the fair-use scale in an excerpter&#8217;s favor are whether its use was commercial, <sup id='fnref:6'><a href='#fn:6' rel='footnote'>6</a></sup> transformative, <sup id='fnref:7'><a href='#fn:7' rel='footnote'>7</a></sup> or parody, <sup id='fnref:8'><a href='#fn:8' rel='footnote'>8</a></sup> the amount copied, <sup id='fnref:9'><a href='#fn:9' rel='footnote'>9</a></sup> and the effect on the market for the original <sup id='fnref:10'><a href='#fn:10' rel='footnote'>10</a></sup>.</p><p>In short, so long as you link back to the original source, and contribute something to the idea, you&#8217;re probably fine legally, but that misses the point. Don&#8217;t copy and paste an entire post from someplace else, but a few sentences to a few paragraphs are cool <em>if it&#8217;s in the context of you making a point</em>. Just like writing a paper for college, be sure to block quote for paragraphs and use quotation marks for sentences, and cite even if you paraphrase, but it still needs to be about your ideas. The Internet may provide users with free e-mail or free information, but it does not provide bloggers with free copy, nor should it.</p><p>The law aside, readers want you to digest and put ideas in your own voice. Take a paragraph from one post, a paragraph from another, and build a common thread between them – that&#8217;s the bigger hurdle. Give readers a reason to come to your site. Give your site a reason to exist, and nine times out of ten, the law will be on your side.</p><p>[Photo courtesy <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/talllguy/2146845610/'>tallguy</a>]</p><div class='footnotes'><hr /><ol><li id='fn:1'>
<p>Questions asked included: If there&#8217;s no copyright symbol, is it still copyrighted?; If it&#8217;s posted online, can I just copy it because its it&#8217;s in the public domain?; Can I use it if I&#8217;m not selling it?; and It&#8217;s okay to use if I credit the original author, right?.</p>

      <p>I am gave a brief <a href='http://www.meetup.com/wordpressdc/events/16887732/'>lightning talk at April&#8217;s WordPress DC Meetup</a> on the basics of HTML and PHP (&#8220;coding for dummies&#8221;). The goal: learn how to avoid breaking your website if you edit it. Below are the <a href='#deck'>slides</a> and <a href='#recording'>recording</a>.</p><p><strong>In invite you to <a href='#deck'>watch</a>, but in short, the Cliff&#8217;s Notes are:</strong></p><ul>

<p>The process</p>

<ul>
<li>The server executes PHP and outputs HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.<img alt='' src='http://ben.balter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/infographic-300x138.png' /></li>

<li>The user&#8217;s browser takes that output and renders a visual representation of the page</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>Client-side Languages</p>

<ul>
<li>HTML – Static (unchanging) content; provides structure</li>

<li>CSS – Provides style and form</li>

<li>JavaScript – Provides interactivity</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>PHP – Wrapped with &#8221;<code>php</code>&#8221; and &#8221;<code>?&gt;</code>&#8221;</p>

<ul>
<li>Variable - Text, a number, true/false, or a group of variable; identified by &#8221;<code>$</code>&#8221;</li>

<li><code>If</code> Statement – performs an action <em>if</em> a statement is true</li>

<li><code>While</code> Loop – performs an action <em>while</em> a statement is true</li>

<li><code>For</code> / <code>Foreach</code> – combines elements of <code>while</code> and <code>if</code></li>

<li>Functions – predefined set of actions; always followed by &#8221;<code>( )</code>&#8221;</li>

<li>Don&#8217;t forget semicolons</li>

      <p><a href='http://wordpress.org'><img alt='Golden Hammer' src='http://wordpress.org' /></a></p><p>My biggest gripe with <a href='http://wordpress.org'>WordPress</a>, the open-source <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system'>content management system</a> that silently works behind the scenes to power <a href='http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all'>more than 13%</a> of the Internet, is that it sets far too high a bar with which other applications must compete. I cannot count the number of times that I have used a proprietary or commercial system and silently thought to myself, &#8221;<em>WordPress can do this so much better</em>.&#8221; <sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup></p><p>This ritual saw no deviation, when I sat down to setup <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SharePoint'>SharePoint</a> in support of my <a href='http://pcjl.org'>law journal</a>‘s upcoming publication workflow. Like Alice stumbling down the rabbit hole, it quickly became apparent that in the counterintuitive world of Sharepoint, each step was going to be more and more alien than the last. And then it dawned on me: a corollary of <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfztIIqbTI#t=1m3s'>Uncle Ben&#8217;s law</a>, <em>with great power does not have to come great complexity</em>.</p><p>WordPress does many things right. It is an incredibly versatile tool, but like a body builder with a heart of gold, it is as friendly and approachable as it is powerful. WordPress has <a href='http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk?rev=3'>more than eight years of rock-solid experience</a> storing, organizing, sorting, and searching all sorts of user-generated content. Its got a set of slick attachment functions to allow users to safely and securely upload and store their non-WordPress files in WordPress. For the past three years, it even has a proto-version control system in the form of its much-envied <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Revision_Management'>post revisions</a>. <sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup> And it does all this through an interface so dumb-simple that <a href='http://www.thegrandparentsblog.com/'>even your grandparents could start their own site</a>. It seems like a no brainer then, to marry these tools to create a WordPress-based document management system.</p><p>Imagine a workflow management and version control system <a href='http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2011-March/038727.html'>building on WordPress&#8217;s existing core competencies</a>. By treating documents as a custom post type, users can leverage the power of WordPress&#8217;s extensive attachment, revision, taxonomy, and URL rewriting functionalities. Document permalinks can be routed through the traditional rewrite structure such that the latest revision of a file always remains at a static, authenticated URL, and users can toggle the visibility of documents (both internally and externally) as they currently do with post statuses and permissions. Similarly, file locking can extend WordPress&#8217;s autosave functionality (as a ping), revision logs can extend WordPress&#8217;s existing revision relationship and can be outputted as a traditional RSS feed, etc.</p><p><img alt='' src='http://ben.balter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/wireframe.png' /></p><p>As seen in the above wireframe, document revisions would be inextricably linked to the essential WordPress experience. If you know WordPress, you know document revisions. Why reinvent the wheel when you have the best wheel the world has ever seen, and a passionate global community dedicated to improving it? This approach would not simply be limited to traditional documents. Images, PDFs, code — anything the user wants to collaborate with others on, or have a secure revision history can be thrown at it. Academics, lawyers, government folks, the possibilities are endless.</p><p>To be fair, WordPress has been arguably overextended in some cases, <sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup> but I do not believe that to be the case here. Sure any WordPress enthusiast may be guilty of the <a href='http://xkcd.com/801'>bolt-cutter mentality</a> every now and then, but I believe, if anything, it is enterprise stakeholders&#8217; tendency to gravitate toward bloated, commercial systems that is more akin to Wolf Blitzer&#8217;s boat house, and a big reason why is because with the exception of an unnamed <sup id='fnref:4'><a href='#fn:4' rel='footnote'>4</a></sup> content management system&#8217;s poorly executed attempt at document management, no open-source alternatives exist.</p><p>I am working on submitting this idea as a proposed <a href='http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2011'>Google Summer of Code</a> project, <sup id='fnref:5'><a href='#fn:5' rel='footnote'>5</a></sup> with the goal of giving WordPress parity with commercial and proprietary applications and hopefully injecting some open-source goodness into government and other enterprise environments, but before I do, I would love to hear your thoughts. <a href='http://ben.balter.com/contact/'>Get in touch</a>, or <a href='#comments'>leave a comment below</a>.</p><p><strong>Update (8/29)</strong>: The final result of the project is an <a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/08/29/document-management-version-control-for-wordpress/'>Open Source Document Management and Version Control System</a> for WordPress.

    <div class="entrybody">
      <p>I needed a quick-and-easy way to parse Microsoft Word&#8217;s footnote format into a more web-friendly format for a recent project. After a bit of regular expression hacking, I was able to build a WordPress plugin to automatically convert content pasted from Word into a format readable by <a href='http://andrewnacin.com'>Andrew Nacin&#8217;s</a> popular <a href='http://andrewnacin.com/2010/07/24/simple-footnotes-0-3/'>Simple Footnotes</a> plugin.</p><p>The process is surprisingly simple given <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference'>WordPress&#8217;s extensive filter API</a>. First, to grab the footnotes from Word&#8217;s <code>ftnref</code> format:</p><pre><code>//grab all the Word-style footnotes into an array
$pattern = &#39;#&amp;lt;a href\=&amp;quot;\#_ftnref([0-9]+)&amp;quot;&amp;gt;\[([0-9]+)\]&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (.*)#&#39;;
preg_match_all( $pattern, $content, $footnotes, PREG_SET_ORDER);</code></pre><p>This creates an array (<code>$footnotes</code>) with the both the footnote number and the text of the footnote. We then need a way to replace the in-text reference with the parsed footnotes so that Simple Footnotes can understand them. I did this by creating two arrays, a find array and a replace array with each Word-style footnote reference and its Simple Footnote formatted counterpart:</p><pre><code>//build find and replace arrays
foreach ($footnotes as $footnote) {
    $find[] = &#39;#&amp;lt;a href\=&amp;quot;\#_ftn&#39;.$footnote[1].&#39;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;\[&#39;.$footnote[1].&#39;\]&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;#&#39;;
    $replace[] = &#39;[ref]&#39; . str_replace( array(&amp;quot;\r\n&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;\r&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;), &amp;quot;&amp;quot;, $footnote[3]) . &#39;[/ref]&#39;;
}</code></pre><p>Finally, so that the entire replacement can be done in a single pass, push a final find/replace pair into the end of the array, to remove the original footnotes:</p><pre><code>//remove all the original footnotes when done
$find[] = &#39;#&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;\s*&amp;lt;a href\=&amp;quot;\#_ftnref([0-9]+)&amp;quot;&amp;gt;\[([0-9]+)\]&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (.*)\s*&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;\s+#&#39;;
$replace[] = &#39;&#39;;</code></pre><p>Because PHP&#8217;s <code>preg_replace</code> function can handle arrays, all we have to do is run a single function:</p><pre><code>$content = preg_replace( $find, $replace, $content );</code></pre><p>Putting it all together, including a filter hook to call our function and a <code>meta_value</code> flag to prevent parsing on subsequent saves, the result is:</p><pre><code>/*
