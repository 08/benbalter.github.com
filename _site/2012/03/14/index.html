<p><a href='http://ben.balter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/we-hate-cms.png'><img alt='' class='alignright size-medium wp-image-2370' height='223' src='http://ben.balter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/we-hate-cms-300x223.png' title='We hate the term CMS' width='300' /></a>Although a single slide at the time, an interesting idea came out of the “<a href='br'>Content &amp;&amp; Coding != Commodities</a>” panel at SXSW this past weekend: a general <span>disdain for the beloved content management system</span> (CMS).</p>

<p>I have to admit, as someone who’s normally on the code side of things, I was a bit confused.  Near-effortless publishing of content by non-technical users has revolutionized the internet. It’s brought about everything from wikipedia to <span>Awwccupy Wall Street</span> and <span>The Fluffington Post</span>. What’s not to love?</p>

<p>It seems for some writers and subject-matter experts, they first experience the “wonder” described above when it’s bequeathed from on high, generally muttered by an ill-informed member of middle management in the sentence “we’re moving to a (new) CMS.” Put another way, in the enterprise sense, the term CMS has come to describe a vehicle of content commoditization; a means of systematic productization. It’s the four horsemen who warn that your ideas are now a product, a product line which must be properly managed — a metaphor for corporatization of otherwise wholesome trades.</p>

<p>It’s a <em>management</em> tool, often seen as the means by which management can tighten its grip — and with good reason. That’s where the focus has typically been. Yet, content is not something to be managed, nor do we want computers managing writers. <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-1' id='return-note-2020-1' title='See, e.g., The Terminator.  See also Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Don&#8217;t See Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.'><sup>1</sup></a> Instead, the focus needs to be on <em>empowering users</em> to publish content, not on attempting to codify into code, otherwise top-down cultural shifts. So what’s the alternative?</p>

<p><strong>1. Tackle the human challenge alongside the technical one</strong>- Technology caries the potential to be an incredibly disruptive force. It’s not just lines of code that you’re writing, but the rules and values that will eventually govern the organization’s day-to-day activities — decisions that much be thoroughly deliberated and communicated ahead of time.</p>

<p><strong>2. Move beyond <em>managing</em> content</strong> - Don’t use a “CMS” plain and simple. <span>Up until last week</span>, <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-2' id='return-note-2020-2' title='oops.'><sup>2</sup></a> for example, WordPress didn’t call itself a CMS. I idly chalked it up to organizational inertia or technology outpacing documentation, but it may reflect a divergent product philosophy, calling itself a “publishing platform”. Sure, it’s a bit semantic, but there’s two big differences there: First, it’s now about publishing, not about content. It’s about empowering users, providing tool, and getting out of their way. It’s printing press 2.0. Second, it’s a platform, not a manager. It’s about publishing to multiple channels, in multiple formats, and letting others customize and build upon it. It’s the exact opposite of a commoditization.</p>

<p>It’s not about the software, per se, it’s about the philosophy behind it. We need to focus more on user-experience. Not button sizes and colors, like we geeks normally think of when we talk about UX, but on what the user actually does care about at the end of the day. <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-3' id='return-note-2020-3' title='Going back to the journalism example, what motivates a journalist? Bylines matter. Being first/original matters. Size of audience matters. Craft matters. Quality matters. Validation from peers matters. Yet CMSs typically don&#8217;t address any of those things. What do many (sadly often proprietary) CMSs focus on? Systemizing. Analytics. Scale. “Product.”'><sup>3</sup></a> I’m not saying any one piece of software does that, but I know CMSs don’t and should. It’s just a matter of priorities.</p>
