<p>The <a href='http://cfpb.gov'>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> (CFPB), however, is in a unique position. As the newest kid on the block, it’s one of the few government agencies to have been born in a digital era, and more importantly, without the bureaucratic baggage that all too often stymies innovation. They have a chance to “do it right” from the start… and they’re doing just that.</p>

<p><strong>An Agency Born of the Internet Generation</strong></p>

<p>Yesterday, CFPB <a href='http://www.consumerfinance.gov/developers/sourcecodepolicy/'>announced a bureau-wide preference for open source</a> in its shiny new <a href='http://www.consumerfinance.gov/developers/sourcecodepolicy/'>Source Code Policy</a>, by my <a href='http://www.google.com/search?sugexp=chrome,mod=4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=source+code+policy+site%3A.gov'>crude research</a>, a first for any government agency. There are two watershed shifts here: first, that the agency not only should, but <em>must</em> evaluate open source software on equal footing to its proprietary counterparts, a comparison which I believe will <a href='http://www.amazon.com/The-Wealth-Networks-Production-ebook/dp/B0015GWX0S'>increasingly fall in open source’s favor</a>, and second, that unless there’s an overriding security or similar concern <em>not to</em>, public code must be public. <span class='pullquote'>There’s nothing new here</span>. All it says is that we should use the best software for the job (a no-brainier), and that that software, the public’s property, should belong to the public.</p>

<p>So why is this news? Plenty of government entities have <a href='http://www.fcc.gov/blog/contributing-code-back-fcc-govs-open-source-feedback-loop'>released</a> <a href='http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/02/11/whitehousegov-releases-second-set-open-source-code'>source</a> <a href='http://open.nasa.gov'>code</a>, or <a href='https://update.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/open-source-procurement-toolkit'>encouraged the</a><a href='http://www.finance.gov.au/e-government/infrastructure/docs/AGuidetoOpenSourceSoftware.pdf'> use of open</a>-<a href='http://www.tekno.dk/pdf/projekter/p03_opensource_paper_english.pdf'>source software</a>. But no one has come out and <a href='https://twitter.com/#!/victorzapanta/status/189390759181557760'>plainly stated that they were an “open-source agency”</a>, that open source is the new default, and that absent an affirmative step by some nay-sayer, that the public will have access to their code.That’s huge. It’s flipping the burden, and it’s the way things should be from the start.</p>

<p><strong><!--more-->But Where’s the Beef?</strong></p>

<p>That said, <span class='pullquote'>there’s one thing the source code policy is noticeably silent on</span>: <em>the ecosystem</em>. Posting code is great and it’s great that they’ve done the legal legwork so other agencies can follow suit, but that’s just the 1.0. The true power of open source comes not from simply publishing code, but from being a member of a broader coding community. Can a CFPB employee contribute a patch to an existing open source project on CFPB time? <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-1' id='return-note-2020-1' title='In simple terms, the core of open-source projects (as distinct from community-contributed plugins or modules) are primarily fueled by &#8220;patches&#8221; (small code change sets) in response to bugs or feature requests, that get committed to the project&#8217;s codebase and released in subsequent versions.'><sup>1</sup></a> What about contributing to a CFPB project once he or she’s left? What happens to my rights when I fork a <a href='http://github.com/cfpb'>CFPB project on GitHub</a> and send the agency a pull request? <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-2' id='return-note-2020-2' title='If the project is licensed as government work, are my code contributions now government work? Are the government employee lines of code under a broader license, while mine are under a more restrictive license like GPL or apache?'><sup>2</sup></a> Can the agency even accept my code legally? <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-3' id='return-note-2020-3' title='Is this considered a donation for Federal ethics purposes thus requiring disclosure?'><sup>3</sup></a> There’s a lot of legal ambiguity there, and it’s just the kind of legal ambiguity a well-intentioned government attorney can seize upon to gum up the very gears that are driving this incredible move.</p>

<p>We’ve seen the same progression in the open data world. The 1.0 is posting 10 XML files at a gigabyte each — an arms-length relationship with developers — arguably open data simply for open data’s sake. The secret sauce lies in the relationship, in publishing APIs and web services rather than static data, to build an ecosystem around the agency’s work.</p>

<p><strong>An Innovation Ecosystem</strong></p>

<p>Imagine if government agencies served as the catalyst for a <a href='http://ben.balter.com/2012/03/05/wordpress-for-government-and-enterprise/#p[NssBlW]'>joint public-private effort to drive tomorrow’s innovation</a>. We saw this during the space race, and see it today in terms of government-funded research, but by-and-large, open-source coders have yet to be included. Sure we’ve seen the “let’s have some open-source developers build this for us for free” type challenges, but that’s about it. There’s no ecosystem, no community, no push-pull or give-and-take, and I’m worried that <span class='pullquote'>as CFPB’s efforts federate across government, this nuance may not federate along with it</span>.</p>

<p>The agency’s already got <a href='https://github.com/cfpb/transit_subsidy/pull/1'>it’s first public-generated code contribution</a>, and can expect at least one more on <a href='https://gist.github.com/2343578'>their gist of the policy</a> (Ed. note: does CFPB not <em>own</em> a Blue Book?!), but the possibility of such a relationship with the citizenry doesn’t seem contemplated by the policy, let alone included as integrally as it should.</p>

<p>I’d love to see the next iteration of the policy have a third section, “III. Membership in the Open-Source Community” on not just publishing code they’ve developed in house — don’t get me wrong, that’s huge — but actually <em>contributing</em>meaningful code to the broader ecosystem, and working directly with the open-source community to foster an active partnership that delivers the best citizen services possible. It’s a dialog, not a code dump. There needs to be a conversation there.</p>

<p><strong>Procure, Publish, Participate.</strong></p>

<p>It’s the realization that <span class='pullquote'>when you use open-source software, you’re not a customer</span>. You’re a member of a community. You’re invited to a pot-luck dinner. There’s not the same sense of entitlement you have with proprietary software. It’s not that they owe you a given feature. There’s no financial transaction there. It’s that that feature hasn’t been developed yet, but can be, the same way every other feature has evolved, through community contributions. There’s an entirely different philosophy driving the relationship.</p>

<p>For open source in government to work, it’s got to move beyond procuring community contributed open-source projects on the one hand, and releasing open-source code developed in house distinctly on the other. It’s about feeling a sense of belonging. It’s about the agency taking on a sense of ownership in the broader project. It’s about participation. <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-4' id='return-note-2020-4' title='This can manifest itself in lots of different ways, but most tangibly: going to local meetups and conferences (or hosting them); contributing to the project&#8217;s core by introducing new features, documentation, or posting to support forums; abstracting business logic from the start to be more broadly applicable to other developers; outreach and evangelism; and fostering relationships with key stakeholders within the community'><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>I think CFPB gets it in a big way, and the fact that this is memorialized in writing is a major step in the right direction. They’ve got the basic mechanics down — procure open–source projects, publish open-source code — but the missing secret sauce that would really drive the policy home? Participate in the open-source community as a matter of policy.</p>

      <p><a href='http://ben.balter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/we-hate-cms.png'><img alt='' class='alignright size-medium wp-image-2370' height='223' src='http://ben.balter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/we-hate-cms-300x223.png' title='We hate the term CMS' width='300' /></a>Although a single slide at the time, an interesting idea came out of the “<a href='br'>Content &amp;&amp; Coding != Commodities</a>” panel at SXSW this past weekend: a general <span>disdain for the beloved content management system</span> (CMS).</p>

<p>I have to admit, as someone who’s normally on the code side of things, I was a bit confused.  Near-effortless publishing of content by non-technical users has revolutionized the internet. It’s brought about everything from wikipedia to <span>Awwccupy Wall Street</span> and <span>The Fluffington Post</span>. What’s not to love?</p>

<p>It seems for some writers and subject-matter experts, they first experience the “wonder” described above when it’s bequeathed from on high, generally muttered by an ill-informed member of middle management in the sentence “we’re moving to a (new) CMS.” Put another way, in the enterprise sense, the term CMS has come to describe a vehicle of content commoditization; a means of systematic productization. It’s the four horsemen who warn that your ideas are now a product, a product line which must be properly managed — a metaphor for corporatization of otherwise wholesome trades.</p>

<p>It’s a <em>management</em> tool, often seen as the means by which management can tighten its grip — and with good reason. That’s where the focus has typically been. Yet, content is not something to be managed, nor do we want computers managing writers. <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-1' id='return-note-2020-1' title='See, e.g., The Terminator.  See also Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Don&#8217;t See Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.'><sup>1</sup></a> Instead, the focus needs to be on <em>empowering users</em> to publish content, not on attempting to codify into code, otherwise top-down cultural shifts. So what’s the alternative?</p>

<p><strong>1. Tackle the human challenge alongside the technical one</strong>- Technology caries the potential to be an incredibly disruptive force. It’s not just lines of code that you’re writing, but the rules and values that will eventually govern the organization’s day-to-day activities — decisions that much be thoroughly deliberated and communicated ahead of time.</p>

<p><strong>2. Move beyond <em>managing</em> content</strong> - Don’t use a “CMS” plain and simple. <span>Up until last week</span>, <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-2' id='return-note-2020-2' title='oops.'><sup>2</sup></a> for example, WordPress didn’t call itself a CMS. I idly chalked it up to organizational inertia or technology outpacing documentation, but it may reflect a divergent product philosophy, calling itself a “publishing platform”. Sure, it’s a bit semantic, but there’s two big differences there: First, it’s now about publishing, not about content. It’s about empowering users, providing tool, and getting out of their way. It’s printing press 2.0. Second, it’s a platform, not a manager. It’s about publishing to multiple channels, in multiple formats, and letting others customize and build upon it. It’s the exact opposite of a commoditization.</p>

<p>It’s not about the software, per se, it’s about the philosophy behind it. We need to focus more on user-experience. Not button sizes and colors, like we geeks normally think of when we talk about UX, but on what the user actually does care about at the end of the day. <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-3' id='return-note-2020-3' title='Going back to the journalism example, what motivates a journalist? Bylines matter. Being first/original matters. Size of audience matters. Craft matters. Quality matters. Validation from peers matters. Yet CMSs typically don&#8217;t address any of those things. What do many (sadly often proprietary) CMSs focus on? Systemizing. Analytics. Scale. “Product.”'><sup>3</sup></a> I’m not saying any one piece of software does that, but I know CMSs don’t and should. It’s just a matter of priorities.</p>

  </ul>
</div>
<p>WordPress’s disproportionately low government adoption is arguably the result of a handful of factors. For one, custom post types, the feature that formally graduated WordPress from a mere blogging platform into a full-fledged content management system, has only been around since June of last year. Yet, even among new sites, <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-1' id='return-note-2020-1' title='Update (3/7): As many have pointed out, a lot of the misinformation may also be traced back to somewhat of a decision lag. Custom post types, custom taxonomies, and WordPress multisite &mdash; three key features that although minor from a technical standpoint, really served as the fundamental shift to transition the platform from blog+ to full-fledged CMS &mdash; came about only three major versions ago (WordPress 3.0). While eighteen months may be an eternity for the vast majority of the technology sector (the iPad 1 had just barely launched eighteen months ago for comparison), in the Government space, procurement regulations dictate that such lag times are all but the norm. As a result, in an already risk-averse contracting environment, we may actually be seeing numbers that more accurately reflect say, WordPress 2.9&#8242;s reception in the Government sector &mdash; a snapshot of when an agency chose a CMS at the onset of a multi-year procurement &mdash; rather than those that accurately reflect its technical capabilities today.'><sup>1</sup></a> the ratio remains somewhat stagnant, if not shrinking, leaving one to believe that the technology has lapped its own already stellar perception.</p>

<p>When you stack the two side by side (or against any other CMS for that matter), WordPress is objectively the prudent choice. On paper, you’d be hard-pressed to make the case for anything else. But, <span class='pullquote'>it’s not a technical problem. It’s a human one.</span> It seems that WordPress’s greatest asset – ease of use that has resulted in widespread adoption by a largely non-technical user base – is threatening to become its greatest liability.</p>

<p>Among those empowered to make purchasing decisions, there seems to be a sense that WordPress is what you use on the weekends to post pictures of your lunch while Drupal is what you use for “serious” business, and with good reason. For better or for worse, Drupal has positioned itself as not just a CMS, but rather <em>the</em> enterprise solution — an inseparable fifth layer of the increasingly ubiquitous enterprise LAMPD stack.</p>

<h2 id='beyond_cowboy_coders'><strong>Beyond Cowboy Coders</strong></h2>

<p>Not surprisingly, the two communities are a reflection of their underlying software’s position in the broader market. CodePoet.com, for example, a directory of WordPress consultants curated by Automattic, lists <a href='http://codepoet.com/browse/regions/north-america/platforms/wordpress/project-size/250000-250000/'>a mere thirteen firms in North America that seek jobs over $250,000</a>(often a small price tag for government or corporate sites), while its Drupal counterpart lists roughly 80 firms that specifically target <a href='http://drupal.org/marketplace-preview/all/Government'>government</a>, <a href='http://drupal.org/marketplace-preview/all/Corporate'>enterprise</a>, and <a href='http://drupal.org/marketplace-preview/all/Non-Governmental-Organizations'>NGO clients</a> daily.</p>

<p>I am not suggesting that freelance developers should bring an end to what makes WordPress WordPress and change out of their shorts and sandals this instant or that they become intimately familiar with the nuances of federal procurement law, nor am I suggesting that small shops seek to bite off more than they can realistically chew anytime soon. I am suggestion, however, that there are small, tangible steps that the community can take to make headway into the government and enterprise space and gradually entrench WordPress as a viable alternative to otherwise subpar software harming innocent public servants.</p>

<h2 id='1_outdated_language'>1. <code>_Deprecate( ‘</code>Outdated Language<code>’ )</code></h2>

<p>The results of the recent WordPress survey suggest that the majority of sites use WordPress <em>as a CMS</em>. That’s like saying the majority of drivers use their Cadillac <em>as an automobile</em>. WordPress <em>is</em>a CMS. Yet, no one seems to be saying that. WordPress.org calls the software a “blog tool”, the WordPress Features codex page <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Features'>describes the site that the software creates as a “weblog” no less than 28 times</a>, <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-3' id='return-note-2020-3' title='Update (3/8): The features page is part of a community edited Wiki (the WordPress Codex) and since originally posted, I&#8217;ve gone through and reworked much of the blog-specific language. View the original.'><sup>3</sup></a> and the first search result for “WordPress CMS,” <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lastnode/Wordpress_CMS'>describes “what aspects of the WordPress… need to be changed in order to turn WordPress into a CMS.”</a></p>

<p>Especially in the buttoned-up context of corporate and government installs, “blog” can be a dirty word. Yet, to get the title of any site, the command we all still run is <code>get_bloginfo()</code>. Inside <code>&lt;?php</code> tags and out, <span class='pullquote'>the technology we have created has far outpaced the metaphor we use to describe it.</span></p>

<h2 id='2_make_new_friends'>2. Make New Friends</h2>

<p>In a typical procurement, be it a federal agency, mid-sized corporation, or local municipality, the CMS does not come first. In fact, many stakeholders wouldn’t know the site’s underlying technology if it weren’t for the logo on the login screen. A firm with a strong reputation in the industry is sought, and based largely on their recommendation, the technology – be it proprietary, open-source, or purpose-built – is chosen by evaluating each across a handful of metrics.</p>

<p>We all know the decision points. Performance and scaling, handing of complex data types, managing user roles, etc. All challenges that WordPress doesn’t even flinch at, yet the perception among the uninitiated is still widely that between open-source alternatives, WordPress is the least-accomplished in the bunch. Whether its reaching out and inviting nearby firms to your next meetup, giving a WordPress talk at a non-WordPress conference, or just being an exemplar in your local development community, <span class='pullquote'>we need to show the tie-wearing few in the conference room that you don’t have to be boring, overly complex, or unnecessarily expensive to get the job done right.</span></p>

<h2 id='3_but_wait_theres_more'>3. But Wait, There’s More…</h2>

<p>WordPress consultants are great at selling themselves, but rarely does anyone ever sell WordPress. Ask my why an agency or municipality should adopt Sharepoint, and I have page after page of <a href='http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/product/benefits/Pages/default.aspx'>focus-group tested material tailored to my industry</a>. Ask my why anyone should use WordPress, and <a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/09/01/why-wordpress/'>I’m pretty much left to fend for myself</a>. Somewhat counterintuitive in a world of free software, migrating to WordPress comes with significant costs that firms need to take into account, both real and imagined, costs that the technology’s ambassadors must actively overcome. Beyond actual development and training costs, there are perceived risks of an immature codebase, insecure plugins, and a general inability to do the job.</p>

<p>One of WordPress’s greatest strengths is its tight-nit cadre of dedicated enthusiasts.  Yet it can often be hard for those on the inside to see things as those outside do. Think about those who have not yet tasted just how sweet the punch is. The name WordPress most often makes its way into a CIO’s inbox, for example, only when there’s been a security breach, not when there’s been a feature release. Where other platforms have stagnated, WordPress’s “can-do” attitude has forged onward introducing even more one-of-a-kind features, yet all too often they go unnoticed or underappreciated where it matters. Both collectively and individually, for WordPress to gain the respect of “the man,” we must seek to broadcast its excellence. <span class='pullquote'>Now is not the time for humility</span>.</p>

<h2 id='4_build_serious_features_for_serious_users'>4. Build Serious Features for Serious Users</h2>

<p><a href='http://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/'>WordPress’s core philosophy</a> has always been to “code for the majority” and with the amount of customization required out-of-the-box to do just about anything, arguably Drupal’s philosophy has been “code for yourself.” While Automattic does a great job with <a href='http://en.wordpress.com/notable-users/'>the CNN’s and TechCrunch’s of the world</a>, there’s a huge opportunity here for developers to fill a void by giving rise to a new generation of core features, plugins, and themes with “serious” implementations in mind. Rather than another social media plugin, what’s the next big thing? Large-scale data? Geolocation? APIs and interoperability?</p>

<p>NASA’s space-race supercharching of the aerospace industry brought consumers everything from Super Soakers to sun glasses, and <span class='pullquote'>that same reach for the stars philosophy can put yet-unimagined power in the browsers of everyday WordPress users.</span> Distraction free writing and an <em>even</em> more intuitive administrative interface are killer features to be sure, but they are the icing on an already beautiful cake and do little to gain parity with more traditional CMSs let alone take on the CMS space in the “WordPress Way.” A good example of this may be <a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/08/29/wp-document-revisions-document-management-version-control-wordpress/' title='WP Document Revisions — Document Management &amp; Version Control for WordPress'>WP Document Revisions</a>, a document management and workflow management tool built almost solely using core functionality. By leveraging WordPress’s core competencies, the venerable CMS can not only gain a seat at the adult’s table, but exponentially improve the experience for its primary user base as well</p>

<h2 id='frenemies'>Frenemies</h2>

<p>It’s important to note, though, it’s not a zero-sum game. Drupal doesn’t compete with WordPress like McDonalds does with Burger King or Coke with Pepsi. Government support for open-source software is a good thing, regardless of what form it takes. True, an infusion of publicly funded effort into the WordPress code base would invariably advance the software just as government funded research advances hard sciences, but, in the end, everybody wins here.</p>

<p>WordPress and government just make sense. As public institutions both large and small face growing budget concerns and begin to shift many of their services to the web, a platform like WordPress built with engagement, collaboration, and dialogue is the ideal fit, not to mention, incredibly persuasive when compared to expensive, propriety, or purpose-built alternatives.</p>

<h2 id='we_all_have_a_stake'><strong>We All Have a Stake</strong></h2>

<p>Whether WordPress is your primary source of income, a hobby, or just the thing that powers your personal site, we all have a stake in WordPress’s future. It is paramount that the community stays true to its scrappy roots. After all, there’s no sense selling the couch to buy a new TV. Yet, in order to be taken seriously by the public sector as a platform for more than simply sharing photos of kitten and chronicling teenage angst, we must first take ourselves seriously, and take baby steps to bring government adoption in line with the WordPress community’s otherwise unparalleled and well-deserved success.</p>

      <strong>Update (3/7):</strong> As many have pointed out, a lot of the misinformation may also be traced back to somewhat of a <em>decision lag</em>. Custom post types, custom taxonomies, and WordPress multisite — three key features that although minor from a technical standpoint, really served as the fundamental shift to transition the platform from <em>blog+</em> to <em>full-fledged CMS</em> — came about only three major versions ago (WordPress 3.0). While eighteen months may be an eternity for the vast majority of the technology sector (the iPad 1 had just barely launched eighteen months ago for comparison), in the Government space, <a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/11/29/towards-a-more-agile-government/'>procurement regulations dictate that such lag times are all but the norm</a>. As a result, in an already risk-averse contracting environment, we may actually be seeing numbers that more accurately reflect say, WordPress 2.9′s reception in the Government sector — a snapshot of when an agency chose a CMS at the onset of a multi-year procurement — rather than those that accurately reflect its technical capabilities today. <a href='#return-note-2020-1'>↩</a>

      <p>PHP (and the open-source software it powers) often gets a bad rap in many government and enterprise circles, the brunt of such anecdotal cries as “it’s inherently insecure” or “X proprietary product is much safer.” The truth is, much of this unfortunate stereotype is the result of carefully crafted <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt'>fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD)</a>. An established disinformation tactic historically used by big names in software for decades, one of the most notorious instances of FUD being the leaked Microsoft “<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents'>Halloween Documents</a>” that outlined the software firm’s strategy to paint open-source, for example, as more costly or under-supported.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><strong>yes</strong>. In my mind, PHP’s ill-deserved reputation can be traced to three key causes (beyond mere proprietary propaganda):</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>It was</strong> - More than a decade ago, there was a legitimate argument to be made for PHP being insecure. It used to be that PHP shipped with a poorly thought out setting toggled on by default (that any coder worth their weight in Mountain Dew would toggle off) called <code>register_globals</code>. The setting allowed poorly written code to be short-circuited by passing certain parameters in the URL. <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-1' id='return-note-2020-1' title='In simplified terms, if I have the variable $logged_in in my page to store whether a user is logged in or not, and I don’t first set it to false before checking, a visitor could go to mysite.com?logged_in=true, and the page would erroneously think I was logged in.'><sup>1</sup></a> The default was flipped to off in 2000, and removed completely in 2009. End. Of. Story.</li>

<li><strong>It’s ubiquitous</strong> - Combine the traffic of Facebook, Wikipedia, and the White House, and you’ll have a good chunk of the Web’s traffic, not to mention probably a good chunk of the web’s attacks as a result. Saying that makes PHP insecure would logically render Microsoft Windows, the target of most viruses, equally insecure and unusable. It’s just a matter of numbers.</li>

<li><strong>It’s Forgiving</strong> – PHP is a very forgiving programming language, meaning it has a very gentle learning curve and is the first web language of choice for many budding developers. Naturally, inexperienced coders learning to code are going to write inexperienced and thus insecure code. Does that mean it’s insecure? No. Bad code is bad code in any language. Again, it’s a numbers game.</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s next to impossible to say a given language is “insecure.” That’d be like saying English, as a language, is less trustworthy. It just doesn’t make sense. In fact, most research supports the idea that the opposite is the case, that <a href='https://www.infoworld.com/d/open-source-software/report-open-source-tops-proprietary-code-in-quality-187169'>open-source produces better quality code than its closed-source counterparts</a>. Think about it <a href='http://www.commlawblog.com/2010/01/articles/unlicensed-operations-and-emer/fcc-changes-stance-on-opensource-security/'>this way</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Someone – let’s call him Bob – wants to secure a room. But in Bob’s universe, there are no locks. So Bob invents one, and installs it. And realizes he has a huge advantage over would-be intruders. Only Bob knows how the lock works. So no one else knows how to pick it. Bob sets about keeping his lock design a secret.</p>

<p>Alice also needs to secure a room, and she also invents a lock.  Unlike Bob, though, Alice publishes her design – not the set-up for a particular key, of course, but the details of the overall mechanism.</p>

<p>Bob thinks Alice is nuts. Why tell people how your lock works? They’ll just pick it more easily.</p>

<p>Fine, says Alice, good luck keeping your design a secret. It’s going to get out, no matter what you do. And frankly, Bob, your lock probably isn’t all that great. Okay, neither is mine. Not yet. But now that it’s published, people will suggest improvements. Students will do Ph.D. dissertations on making it better. Companies will compete to develop stronger versions. And long after your design has leaked, and instructions for picking it are all over the Internet, my vastly improved lock will be far more secure. Even though everybody will know how it works.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Put another way, unlike many of its commercial counterparts for which obfuscation is a security staple, open source relies on inherently sound security practices to ensure that whatever you want to remain private, remains private.</p>

<p>Last, because open-source projects like PHP are almost always monitored 24/7 by the prying eyes of countless developers scattered around the globe, if a vulnerability does arise, <a href='https://twitter.com/#!/nacin/status/9753986051604480'>it’s often addressed in hours</a>, and you’re not left waiting days or <a href='http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2008/03/07/delays-in-software-patch-pushed-security-firm-to-disclose-vmware-flaw/'>months as in some commercial products</a> for a patch from on high.</p>

<p>Is there insecure PHP code out there? No doubt. I’ve seen it. Does that mean all PHP is insecure? Far from it. Next time someone you know says something to the contrary, subtly mention in passing that you’re really surprised to hear that the company behind their favorite piece of commercial software recently announced they were sunsetting the project, and see how they handle a taste of their own FUD.</p>

      <p>Wired Magazine recently took a turn for the meta. In addition to publishing <a href='http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/02/github/all/1'>their recent story featuring the popular version control site GitHub</a> on Wired.com as they would normally, they also <a href='https://github.com/WiredEnterprise/Lord-of-the-Files'>published it on GitHub itself under a creative commons license</a>, allowing readers to fork and contribute to the story as they saw fit. In <a href='http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/02/github-revisited/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+wired%2Findex+%28Wired%3A+Index+3+%28Top+Stories+2%29%29'>reflecting after the fact</a>, the Wired team said something that stood out to me:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At Wired offices, you hear the question over and over again as we work on stories like the one you’re reading now: “Are you out of the story? I want to go in.” We have a version control problem. We publish Wired.com on WordPress. It’s a decent publishing tool, but when two people change a story at the same time, one of them doesn’t get her changes onto the final story.</p>

<p>We published our GitHub story on GitHub because it was meta-cool. But we also did it to see if GitHub might actually help us solve our problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Spoiler alert: it didn’t. GitHub’s great for a lot of things, source code chief among them, but it’s not for the faint of heart. There’s a great deal of command line, and general geekery involved that raise the barriers to entry just high enough to keep it out of everyday newsrooms and editorial workflows. <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-1' id='return-note-2020-1' title='Having recently given this a try — using GitHub to curate a collaboratively edited list of open-source alternatives to proprietary software — I know first-hand how off-putting GitHub can be to non-technical users.'><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<div style='border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px;'>
  <strong>The Pitch:</strong><em> What if we could re-imagine WordPress’s ease-of-use and intuitively dumb-simple workflow to introduce a layer of GitHub’s collaborative fork-and-merge horsepower under the hood? </em>
</div><!--more-->
<ul>
<li>Collaborative editing (by resolving two users’ conflicted saves  – Wired’s example)</li>

<li>Saving draft changes of already-published content</li>

<li>Scheduling pending changes to already-published content</li>

<li>Allowing users without edit or publish capabilities to edit and submit changes to content (similar to GitHub’s pull request system)</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d imagine the workflow would go something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>User without the ability to edit an existing post has changes to make</li>

<li>User “forks” the post, making any change they deem necessary</li>

<li>When done, user attempts to merge changes back into the original</li>

<li>Post goes into standard WordPress “pending review” workflow</li>

<li>Editor is presented with diff (using the built-in diff engine), and can automatically accept changes (if there are no conflicts), or manually merge the two if necessary</li>

<li>Post is re-published with updated content, revision logs merged to reflect history</li>
</ol>

<p>In a nutshell:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Extends WordPress’s existing revision system</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Clone existing posts, edit, and “republish”</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Schedule changes to posts, including taxonomies and metadata</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Pending changes diff view, front-end preview of changes</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Using WordPress’s pending-review system, integrates with existing plugins for notifications, management, etc.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Ability to store “commit messages” with each post revision to explain to others what changes were made and why</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Automatically merges (non-conflicted) changes (based on existing diff engine)</p>

<ol>
<li>One sided changes – one overwrites the other</li>

<li>Two sided non-conflict changes – automatically merge</li>

<li>Conflicted changes – note conflicts in fork and prepare for re-merge</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Post forking may make for a killer plugin <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-2' id='return-note-2020-2' title='Full disclosure: two plugins, Revisionary and Duplicate Post exist, but they don&#8217;t take the idea nearly as far as the above proposes, nor do they do it in &#8220;the WordPress way&#8221;. I&#8217;d hope that even if the idea started as a plugin, it would eventually be incorporated as core functionality.'><sup>2</sup></a> or piece of core functionality… and imagine if it could integrate with other collaboration tools like <a href='http://editflow.org/'>Edit Flow</a>, or <a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/08/29/wp-document-revisions-document-management-version-control-wordpress/'>WP Document Revisions</a>? As in Wired’s example, it has the potential to fundamentally change newsrooms and other editorial workflows. All of a sudden, any content becomes either publicly or privately collaborative. Pretty cool, huh? While it may be a bit ahead of it’s time from a human standpoint, from a technical standpoint, the technology’s there — it’s nothing new — just a matter of building it, and hopefully solving the dreaded “are you out yet?” problem.</p>

<p>Thoughts? Would you use this? What else would you like to see it do? <a href='http://ben.balter.com/contact/'>Drop me a line</a>, or let me know in the <a href='#comments'>comments below</a>?</p>

<p><strong>Update (3/5): </strong>The plan right now is to submit this as a <a href='http://ben.balter.com/tag/gsoc/'>Google Summer of Code</a> project, so if all goes well, look for the above-outlined functionality in a WordPress install near you towards the end of the summer. In the mean time, the continued thoughts/feedback is very greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>To better embrace innovation and respond to changing organizational needs, the Government must embrace a two-pronged approach involving both regulatory reform and top-down support for best-practices education to empower IT-procuring agencies to pursue more agile software development methods.  By requiring that detailed specifications be outlined at the onset of the process, government procurement regulations encourage the less flexible, waterfall development techniques, rather than the more modern, agile development approaches used by the private sector today. <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-16' id='return-note-2020-16' title='DoD Acquisition Report, supra note 1, at 16-17 (noting many large corporations have gained a significant advantage from using agile).  See White House Forum On Modernizing Gov&#8217;t, Overview And Next Steps 9 (&#8220;Federal IT projects are too often marked by milestones spaced too far apart.&#8221;).  See generally infra Parts III-IV.'><sup>16</sup></a>  While most prior attempts to reform federal IT procurement focused solely on statutory changes, <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

  I. Background — Waterfall v. Agile
</h2>
<p>Two primary schools of thought exist regarding software development practices: waterfall and agile software development.  While today’s contracting regulations may propel agencies to use waterfall development, changes in industry practice with regard to large IT projects demands a government push toward more agile methodologies.</p>

  A. Waterfall Software Development Sees Modern Software Development as an Extension of its Traditional Engineering Roots
</h3>
<p>The traditional approach, “waterfall” software development, <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-18' id='return-note-2020-18' title='A more in-depth examination of the characteristics of waterfall development is discussed infra part II.'><sup>18</sup></a> seeks all requirements and specifications up front, distinguishing design and analysis from construction and development. <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-19' id='return-note-2020-19' title='Adrian Royce, Agile in Government: Successful On-Time Delivery of Software 1, in Conference Papers, 20th Australian Software Engineering Conference (2009).'><sup>19</sup></a>  Waterfall development techniques trace their roots to long-standing engineering fields such as architecture and electrical engineering. <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-20' id='return-note-2020-20' title='Martin Fowler, The New Methodology, Martin Fowler (Dec. 13, 2005), http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/newMethodology.html.'><sup>20</sup></a>  In such fields, late changes are costly and rigid requirements are a practical necessity. <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-21' id='return-note-2020-21' title='For example, an architect draws up blueprints for a house and hands them off to a contractor for construction.  Should the future homeowner decide after the fact that he wishes to deviate from his original plan, e.g., he prefers the kitchen be five feet wider, such a change would incur substantial time, labor, and material costs as floors are re-laid, pipes re-plumbed, and electrical outlets rewired accordingly.'><sup>21</sup></a>  With the rise of software development in the latter half of the twentieth century, engineers applied the same methodology to developing computer software.</p>

<p>Despite their similar roots, traditional engineering is not a perfect metaphor for software development. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;a class=&quot;simple-footnote&quot; title=&quot;Initially the application of the traditional methodology to the emerging field was much more straightforward.  Room-sized mainframe computers required users to painstakingly code instructions on physical cards, submit them to be processed in batches, and await the result. James O. Coplien &amp; Gertrud Bjørnvig, Lean Architecture: For Agile Software Development, 218 (2010).  Today, however, advances in technology and the personal computer have allowed the software development environment to embody an interactive process whereby software engineers can receive immediate feedback as to their software&amp;#8217;s success or failure. Id. at 218-19 (noting that originally high computing costs drove up the cost of mistakes such that &amp;#8220;rigid disciplines ruled.&amp;#8221; Today, mistakes are cheap.).&quot; id=&quot;return-note-2020-22&quot; href=&quot;#note-2020-22&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</pre>  First, unlike traditional engineering fields, software development benefits from nearly negligible switching costs. <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-23' id='return-note-2020-23' title='Fowler, supra note 20.  If a federal agency decides that the navigation menu on its new website should be five pixels larger, to make such a change would simply require modifying one or two values in the website&#8217;s source code, an insubstantial labor cost in a large government contract.'><sup>23</sup></a>  Second, the bulk of most software development projects is design and system architecture, a process requiring creative and analytical, rather than technical talent. <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-24' id='return-note-2020-24' title='Id.'><sup>24</sup></a>  In a world of widely adopted industry conventions, the creative necessities of a large-scale procurement project’s information architecture often overshadow technical necessities. <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-25' id='return-note-2020-25' title='Information architecture necessities can include the creation of user profiles (personas of hypothetical system users), use cases (an analysis of the tasks those users might perform), and wireframes (the visual layout of the system&#8217;s interfaces).  Id.'><sup>25</sup></a>  Third, because software development regularly prioritizes designing ideal workflows and simplifying human interactions rather than embracing a formulaic science, such creative processes cannot easily be planned or predicted. <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-26' id='return-note-2020-26' title='See Fowler, supra note 20.'><sup>26</sup></a>  In light of these industry trends, modern software development has recently embraced a more integrated practice known as agile software development. <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-27' id='return-note-2020-27' title='Mark Lycett et al., Migrating Agile Methods to Standardized Development Practice, Computer, June 2003, at 79, 79.'><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p>Agile development adopts an incremental approach to software development, but it does not seek to build software systems in a sequential, step-wise manner.  Instead it recognizes the reality that a future system owner may be unable to gather all requirements up front. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

  A. The Rigidity of the Waterfall Process Brings Several Advantages to Federal IT Procurement
</h3>
<p>In both form and function, waterfall development mirrors current procurement models.  The first step requires that future system owners document their needs extensively, and such requirements are easily incorporated into a solicitation.  This up-front documentation allows agencies to safely budget funds and allows contracting officers (COs) to marry funds to specific, pre-defined contractual events.  “Phase gates” within the contract provide agencies objective standards to evaluate a project’s propensity for success and allow agencies to abandon projects in some instances when the prospect of successful delivery appears grim.  Within an agency, waterfall development requires COs to justify projects to stakeholders early in the development cycle, and this overall process has gained agencies’ tacit endorsement over the years. <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-46' id='return-note-2020-46' title='Richard K.

  B. Waterfall Software Development Fails to Adequately Respond to the Ever-Changing Conditions that Make Up a Project’s Problem Space
</h3>
<p>Despite its long-standing history, waterfall software development comes with shortcomings.  The outdated methodology assumes requirements can be predicted upfront.  As a result it fails to adequately respond to changing conditions and forces agencies to incur costs disproportionate to project returns.</p>

  i. Both conceptually and practically, waterfall assumes that contracting agencies can accurately forecast a project’s requirements in advance
</h4>
<p>Waterfall relies on two key assumptions: (A) That requirements are fully understood by both contractor and contracting agency, and (B) That requirements are unlikely to change. <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-47' id='return-note-2020-47' title='Szalvay, supra note 6, at 1-3; Course Manual, supra note 28, at 33.  Such an approach makes sense when it is traced backed to its traditional roots.  Engineers building bridges rely on well-established laws of physics supported by the fundamentals of mathematics, two sciences that are rigidly defined and easily relied upon.  Software development, on the other hand, is not bound by the rules of the physical world.  Gravity, an assumed constant in engineering, has relatively little relevance to programming.'><sup>47</sup></a>  Yet due to the often-unique nature of government systems, software contractors typically face challenges to which they have never been exposed, rendering predicting of future needs an inherently futile task. <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-48' id='return-note-2020-48' title='See Mark Leicester, Government Projects the Agile Way: Can It Be Done?, St. Services Commission (Apr. 16, 2009), http://www.ssc.govt.nz/blog/government-projects-agile-way-can-it-be-done.'><sup>48</sup></a></p>

<p>The traditional procurement model, which leans heavily on waterfall’s central tenants, demands specificity in planning, funding, and acquisition, and requires the contractors and COs to attain a certain level of “predictive precision” simply not found in the ever-changing world of technology. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

This would be easy if you had no opponent.  When the other team begins moving forward there&#8217;s no way to . . . know how to optimally get to the other side, and waterfall software development expects just that.

<p>The unrealistic premises of waterfall procurement create a snowball effect.  Because it is impossible for COs to resolve all unknowns at the onset of a procurement, they often err on the side of caution and compound errors by over-documenting requirements and making erroneous assumptions. <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-51' id='return-note-2020-51' title='Sherman, supra note 15, at 210-11; Poppendieck, supra note 32, at 1, 5 (arguing &#8220;the more companies attempted to define the process of product development, the less the organization was able to carry out that process&#8221;).'><sup>51</sup></a>  This risk is further exacerbated as a result of waterfall’s insistence on delaying testing until late in the development cycle, <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-52' id='return-note-2020-52' title='Further Details, supra note 49.'><sup>52</sup></a> meaning mistakes often do not become apparent until corrections are cost-prohibitive. <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-53' id='return-note-2020-53' title='Id.'><sup>53</sup></a>  Especially given the size of typical government procurements, “<span>t</span>rying to implement everything at once increases the risk of failure on a grand scale if the technology fails to work as expected or if the original idea was misconceived.” <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-54' id='return-note-2020-54' title='Id.

<h4 class='toc' id='agile-is-inherently-less-costly-than-waterfall'>
  iii. Agile is inherently less costly than waterfall
</h4>
<p>Agile projects tend to be less costly overall for three primary reasons.<strong> </strong>First, because COs do not have to spend extensive time pre-award defining project requirements, agile development inherently imposes a lesser administrative burden. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

<h4 class='toc' id='agile-is-predictable'>
  iv. Agile is predictable
</h4>
<p>While at first glance agile may seem less predictable, decreasing the amount of speculation involved in decision making inherently increases the predictability of the final outcome. <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-106' id='return-note-2020-106' title='See Poppendieck, supra note 32, at 3.'><sup>106</sup></a>  Unlike waterfall’s hands-off approach, small increments of constant feedback provide a safety net of predictability upon which the contracting agency can base its decisions. <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-107' id='return-note-2020-107' title='Id.; DoD Acquisition Report, supra note 1, at 47-48, 53.'><sup>107</sup></a></p>

  C. Despite its Advantages, Agile Methodologies Present Contracting Officers With Several Key Challenges
</h3>
<p>Agile’s define-as-you-go approach does not often lend itself to satisfying government documentation requirements.  Its lack of pre-award specificity makes costs difficult to estimate, and, when compared to waterfall, agile exposes the contracting agency to greater risk. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

<p>Extensive government contracting documentation and reporting requirements impose the greatest barrier to the adoption of agile procurement in the U.S.<strong> </strong>Traditional government contracting requires that project “artifacts” be generated at each step of the process to memorialize project activity. <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-109' id='return-note-2020-109' title='Glen B.

  V. Significant Reform is Necessary to Allow Federal IT Procurement to Take Advantage of Industry Advances that Have Far Outpaced Laws Intended to Govern Them
</h2>
<p>For the Federal Government to become more agile, three distinct but parallel initiatives are necessary.  First, COs and technical representatives must be educated as to the best practices for implementing agile in government contracting.  Second, statutory requirements encouraging agencies into waterfall frameworks by demanding extensive requirements documentation pre-award should be avoided through alternative contracting vehicles.  Finally, even if permitted by law, proponents must garner significant top-down support from within their agencies for agile practices to be accepted.</p>
<h3 class='toc' id='cos-and-cotrs-require-education-before-agile-can-be-introduced-to-the-federal-contracting-environment'>
  A. COs and COTRs Require Education Before Agile Can be Introduced to the Federal Contracting Environment
</h3>
<p>Before federal IT procurement can embrace agile methodologies, best-practices education is required on two levels.  First, COs must learn best practices for agile contracting. Second, technical officers within the agency must learn best practices for agile project management in the government sector.****</p>
<h4 class='toc' id='cos-must-learn-best-practices-in-agile-contracting'>
  i. COs must learn best-practices in agile contracting
</h4>
<p>Many COs may not know what agile development is, let alone that it is a potential contracting vehicle and how best to implement it.  The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) should oversee the joint efforts of the General Services Administration (GSA), the White House OMB, <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-150' id='return-note-2020-150' title='Strengthening IT program management by exposing best practices and aligning IT procurement with innovation is a central tenet of the White House&#8217;s plan to reform federal IT.  Kundra, supra note 13, at 17 (noting &#8220;[t]he acquisition process can require program managers to specify the [G]overnment&#8217;s requirements up front, which can be years in advance of program initiation . . .

<span class='pullquote'>Solicitations should outline functional rather than technical requirements</span><h4 class='toc' id='agency-technical-contacts-cotrs-must-learn-best-practices-in-agile-project-management'>
  ii. Agency technical contacts (COTRs) must learn best practices in agile project management
</h4>
<p>Alongside existing professional development efforts, contracting organization technical representatives must be trained in best practices for executing and managing development projects through an agile framework.  This may include formal workshops for employees; the recruitment of experienced, private sector project managers; or simply a push to increase awareness of agile methodology and educational resources already at agencies’ disposal.</p>
<h3 class='toc' id='existing-procurement-requirements-demand-extensive-documentation-up-front-forcing-agencies-into-agile-frameworks'>
  B. Existing Procurement Requirements Demand Extensive Documentation Up Front, Forcing Agencies into Agile Frameworks
</h3>
<p>Even if an agile-friendly contracts are prepared, executed, and overseen successfully, two statutory stumbling blocks may hinder agile’s adoption: (i) the solicitation and subsequent award of the contract; and (ii) the governance of the contract while it is in progress. <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-153' id='return-note-2020-153' title='This holds true for both the FAR and DoD regulations.  DoD Acquisition Report, supra note 1, at 4.'><sup>153</sup></a></p>
<h4 class='toc' id='engineering-services-far-part-36'>
  i. Engineering services, FAR Part 36
</h4>
<p>The single largest statutory roadblock to agile-friendly contracts is the requirement for technical specifications prior to solicitation.  This requirement locks contracting agencies into a waterfall method post-award and is antithetical to agile methodologies.  To pursue an agile framework, agencies should establish functional rather than technical benchmarks, developing a framework that can be used to define the focus of each subsequent sprint.</p>

<p>Part 36 of the FAR provides a modified procedure for procuring architectural and engineering services. <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-154' id='return-note-2020-154' title='FAR 36.601.'><sup>154</sup></a>  Such a procurement would follow a two-phase procedure.  In phase one competing firms would submit proposals including their technical approaches and technical qualifications, but these would not include detailed design information or cost or price information.  Agencies would then rank the top firms, which would be asked to submit detailed proposals before the winning firm was selected for a contract to be executed through the design-build framework. <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-155' id='return-note-2020-155' title='FAR 36.602-1.'><sup>155</sup></a></p>

<p>Under FAR 36.601(4)(a)(3), to be eligible for the architecture-engineering route, the acquisition must “logically or justifiably require performance by registered architects or engineers or their employees.” <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-156' id='return-note-2020-156' title='FAR 36.601(4)(a)(3).  The U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics classifies the software engineering role as a subset of computer specialist, see http://www.bls.gov/soc/soc_structure_2010.pdf, while all other engineering disciplines are a subset of engineer, http://www.bls.gov/soc/soc_structure_2010.pdf.  Additionally, software engineers do not receive professional engineering licenses from the state.  If a state were to grant such a license, this would serve as an interesting test case.'><sup>156</sup></a>  Congress should expand the definition of this section to include computer and software engineers to allow IT procurement to follow this route.</p>
<h4 class='toc' id='modular-contracting-far-part-39'>
  ii. Modular contracting, FAR Part 39
</h4>
<p>FAR 39.103 allows agencies to break large acquisitions into several smaller acquisition increments. <a class='simple-footnote' href='#note-2020-157' id='return-note-2020-157' title='FAR 39.103 (implementing the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-106).'><sup>157</sup></a>  To aid in accounting, budgeting, and documentation, an agile procurement can be contracted as one overarching contract defining the scope of the work and outlining a schedule by which each sprint’s focus will be defined.  This large contract may incorporate smaller contracts for each subsequent sprint, if necessary, as part of a process wholly in line with the Government’s push toward system-oriented architectures.</p>
<h3 class='toc' id='cos-lack-top-down-support-for-it-procurement-reform'>
  C. COs Lack Top-Down Support for IT Procurement Reform
</h3>
<p>The above goals cannot be realized without significant top-down support from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, OMB, and Chief Technology Officers at each agency.  COs must be empowered to take risks with such an unconventional approach.  While top administration officials have made statements supporting an agile approach to IT procurement reform, such rhetoric remains noncommittal.  <span class='pullquote'>Tangible, specific guidance from senior administration officials to agency CIOs and CFOs must occur in order for innovation to succeed</span>.</p>
<h2 class='toc' id='conclusion'>
  VI. Conclusion
</h2>
<p>The federal IT procurement system is outdated.  Projects are consistently delivered late, over-budget, and obsolete.  Much of this trend can be traced back to flawed legal frameworks that lock agencies and contractors into an outdated development model.  Through education, reform, and organization-wide support, federal agility can become a reality.  Any computer user knows that as systems age they begin to slow.  Today, the federal IT procurement system is running slowly, to the detriment of both agencies and the public, and it is long overdue for a system-wide upgrade.</p>

      For example, an architect draws up blueprints for a house and hands them off to a contractor for construction.  Should the future homeowner decide after the fact that he wishes to deviate from his original plan, e.g., he prefers the kitchen be five feet wider, such a change would incur substantial time, labor, and material costs as floors are re-laid, pipes re-plumbed, and electrical outlets rewired accordingly. &lt;a href=&quot;#return-note-2020-21&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;

      Initially the application of the traditional methodology to the emerging field was much more straightforward.  Room-sized mainframe computers required users to painstakingly code instructions on physical cards, submit them to be processed in batches, and await the result.

Coplien &amp; &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;Gertrud Bjørnvig, Lean Architecture: For Agile Software Development&lt;/span&gt;, 218 (2010).  Today, however, advances in technology and the personal computer have allowed the software development environment to embody an interactive process whereby software engineers can receive immediate feedback as to their software’s success or failure. &lt;em&gt;Id. &lt;/em&gt;at 218-19 (noting that originally high computing costs drove up the cost of mistakes such that “rigid disciplines ruled.” Today, mistakes are cheap.). &lt;a href=&quot;#return-note-2020-22&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;

      &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;.  Similarities can be drawn between modern software development and the Japanese auto industry forty years ago.  Beginning in the 1970s Japanese auto manufacturers began adopting lean manufacturing practices to develop new vehicles. Michael A. Cusumano, &lt;em&gt;Japanese Technology Management: Innovations, Transferability, and the Limitations of “Lean” Production&lt;/em&gt; 1 (Sloan Sch. of Mgmt., Mass. Inst. of Tech., Working Paper No. 3477-92, 1992).   Due to this refined approach’s reduced overhead, Japanese manufacturers were able to generate thirty percent more profit per vehicle than Chrysler, one-hundred percent more per vehicle than Ford, and two-hundred percent more per vehicle than General Motors. &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;Mary Poppendieck, Cutter Consortium Executive Report, Lean Development and the Predictability Paradox&lt;/span&gt; 1 (2003).&lt;em&gt;  &lt;/em&gt;When compared to Detroit’s traditional design and manufacturing practices, Japanese manufacturers produced higher quality vehicles in one-third less time. &lt;em&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;  While in the United States nearly half of all projects missed their target date, in Japan, all but one sixth hit the market on time. &lt;em&gt;Id.  &lt;/em&gt;Japan’s lean-manufacturing methods produced cheaper, more successful cars faster. &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#return-note-2020-32&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;

      A detailed explanation of the evolution to a service-oriented architecture is beyond the scope of this Note, but in simple terms, if one thinks of information as a product, the evolution mimics the move from individual manufacturers producing a good, to a factory producing a good, to that factory adopting an assembly line approach.  A government agency might build a system once, (e.g. an application to calculate the appropriate census block based on a given address,) and then will have subsequent systems query that already-built application, rather than duplicate the functionality.  Any given request for information may go through five, ten, perhaps even a hundred systems, each of which can be procured or upgraded individually.  Interview with Greg Elin, Chief Data Officer, FCC &amp; Michael Byrne, Chief Geographic Info.

      More formally, the standard waterfall process follows five distinct steps: (1) requirements are defined and documented, (2) the system is designed and architected, (3) development teams code the software, (4) the software is tested and validated against the requirements from step one, and finally (5) the system is deployed.  &lt;em&gt;See id&lt;/em&gt;. at 328-29. &lt;a href=&quot;#return-note-2020-45&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;

      A prime example of such a phenomenon is the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO).  In 1983 the PTO initiated a billion-dollar automation effort using waterfall.  At the time the PTO’s patent files contained some thirty-three million documents, supporting patents issued since 1790, and grew at the rate of approximately one million documents per year.  The goal was to have a fully deployed system by 1990, however by 1987, the PTO began to realize that the program was fatally behind schedule and switched to an agile approach.  Course Manual , &lt;em&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt; note 28, at 66-67&lt;strong&gt;.  &lt;/strong&gt;The PTO was able to successfully deploy its patent search system (CSIR) later that year, and by 1992 had a significant portion of its automation system integrated into its workflow. &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;U.S. Gov’t Accountability Office, GAO/AIMD-93-15, Patent and Trademark Office: Key Processes For Managing Automated Patent Development Are Weak&lt;/span&gt; 4 (1993). &lt;a href=&quot;#return-note-2020-62&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;

      &lt;em&gt;See generally&lt;/em&gt; Szalvay, &lt;em&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt; note 6, at 1.  The ability to adapt to change has implications beyond project efficiency as well.  Hackers, cyber terrorists, and other malcontents are not bound by the rigidity of waterfall and are often able to adapt more rapidly to government countermeasures than the Government can develop defenses.  &lt;em&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Federal Executive Roundtable, &lt;em&gt;supra &lt;/em&gt;note 56.  Similarly, after spending nearly two years and 0 million dollars developing handheld computers for use in conjunction with the 2010 census, the U.S. Census Bureau was forced to drop its plans and revert to paper-based collection when it realized the waterfall approach it had adopted would not deliver a working system in time for the census data collection.  &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;White House Forum&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;em&gt;supra &lt;/em&gt;note 5, at 5-6. &lt;a href=&quot;#return-note-2020-63&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;

      The Federal Communications Commission recently procured the National Broadband Map using an agile framework.  Within six months, the agencies had a working prototype, and six months following that, a final product.  Less than ten percent of the project’s total funding was used to make a prototype, the source code of which being distributed alongside the project’s RFQ.  The contract’s first deliverable was requirements documentation outlining a project management plan, but daily scrum meetings provided both agency and contractor the opportunity to revise requirements.  FCC Interview, &lt;em&gt;supra &lt;/em&gt;note 36. &lt;a href=&quot;#return-note-2020-64&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;

      From the agency’s perspective, an agile backlog is simply a wish list of features in priority of business value, wherein the agency lists the functionality it desires from a system and when that can be expected.  From the contractor’s perspective, the backlog is a to-do list, in order of priority, listing the project deliverables and their deadlines. &lt;a href=&quot;#return-note-2020-76&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;

      Strengthening IT program management by exposing best practices and aligning IT procurement with innovation is a central tenet of the White House’s plan to reform federal IT.  &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;Kundra&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;em&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt; note 13, at 17 (noting “[t]he acquisition process can require program managers to specify the [G]overnment’s requirements up front, which can be years in advance of program initiation . . . We need to make real change happen . . . by educating the entire team managing IT projects about the tools available to streamline the acquisition process.”). &lt;a href=&quot;#return-note-2020-150&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;note-2020-151&quot;&gt;
      Ideally instructors would create a scalable model outlining the various issues contracting agencies must broach before pursuing an agile project, such as how to ensure robust competition, how broad or specific the statements of work should be, whether to award to a single vendor or multiple vendors, and when to use fixed-price contracts or rely instead on other contracting vehicles.  &lt;em&gt;See generally &lt;/em&gt;Kundra, &lt;em&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt; note 13. &lt;a href=&quot;#return-note-2020-151&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;note-2020-152&quot;&gt;
      An example of a functional approach would involve requiring that a system use industry best security practices rather than describing a particular encryption algorithm. &lt;a href=&quot;#return-note-2020-152&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;note-2020-153&quot;&gt;
      This holds true for both the FAR and DoD regulations.  &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;DoD Acquisition Report&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;em&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt; note 1, at 4. &lt;a href=&quot;#return-note-2020-153&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;note-2020-154&quot;&gt;
      FAR 36.601. &lt;a href=&quot;#return-note-2020-154&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;note-2020-155&quot;&gt;
      FAR 36.602-1. &lt;a href=&quot;#return-note-2020-155&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;note-2020-156&quot;&gt;
      FAR 36.601(4)(a)(3).  The U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics classifies the software engineering role as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bls.gov/soc/soc_structure_2010.pdf&quot;&gt;subset of computer specialist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;see &lt;/em&gt;http://www.bls.gov/soc/soc_structure_2010.pdf, while all other engineering disciplines are a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bls.gov/soc/soc_structure_2010.pdf&quot;&gt;subset of engineer&lt;/a&gt;, http://www.bls.gov/soc/soc_structure_2010.pdf.  Additionally, software engineers do not receive professional engineering licenses from the state.  If a state were to grant such a license, this would serve as an interesting test case. &lt;a href=&quot;#return-note-2020-156&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;

      <p>Never before has it been so vital that the federal government do more with less. On all sides of the National Mall, government agencies are tightening their belts considerably, but the challenge is not simply about trimming budgets or spending less. In many cases, the problem is a matter of spending smarter.</p>
<div style='float: right; font-size: 13px; padding: 10px; width: 300px;'>
  <h3>
    What is Agile?
  </h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      An incremental approach to software development that breaks a project into many independent, fungible tasks;
    </li>
    <li>
      Does not seek to build software in a sequential, step-wise manner;
    </li>
    <li>
      Recognizes the reality that requirements are unpredictable and change over time; and
    </li>
    <li>
      Plans are continuously inspected and adapted through rapid prototyping.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>While the federal IT infrastructure is beginning to show its age — loosing its ability to serve federal employees and thus more broadly the American public — federal approaches to IT procurement and management are increasingly proving themselves to be equally anachronistic. Traditional heavyweight philosophies known most commonly as waterfall development simply move too slowly for today’s quickly changing federal IT landscape. By the time projects reach completion, all too often, the technology or the customer’s needs have fundamentally changed, and what is delivered does not resemble what is needed. If we wish to create the efficient government of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, we must jettison traditional approaches to IT project management and adopt a more agile model.</p>

<h2 id='technology_that_outpaces_the_laws_that_govern_its_adoption'>Technology that Outpaces the Laws that Govern its Adoption</h2>

<p>Government contracts are rarely written for agile, and with good reason: As a matter of public policy, procurement regulations force agencies to prefer full and open competition over sound project deliverables. By purposeful design, federal procurement emphasizes the process surrounding the purchase, not on the purchase itself. Traditional contracting vehicles call for stable requirements to be outlined up front and rigidly adhered to, regardless of advancements in technology or changes to the agency’s needs. Compounding the problem, <span class='pullquote'>contracting officers must often secure and commit funding well in advance, rendering adaptation impossible and Agile’s “I’ll know it when I see it” approach, somewhat counterintuitive</span>. Finally, due to the significant administrative cost presented to the agency, these restrictions encourage agency-wide transformations to be approached in a large, single pass rather than addressing the component parts individually. These procedural necessities — not usually seen in the private sector — generate significant lead times further hindering agencies’ adoption of any approach that relies on small iterations.</p>
<div style='float: left; font-size: 13px; padding: 10px; width: 300px;'>
  <h3>
    Federal IT Procurement by the Numbers:
  </h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>77.1</strong> – amount in billions the federal government spent on IT in FY2010
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>70</strong> – percent increase in federal IT spending over the past decade
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>1/3</strong> – procured features actually used by the agencies that contract them
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>9</strong> – percentage of federal IT projects delivered on budget and on time
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>These potential stumbling blocks, however, do not necessarily prove fatal. Compared to organizational culture, laws are easy to change given enough pressure by those they govern. Ironically, this seemingly technological challenge is, most elementally, a human one. Federal stakeholders must actively rethink the predominant culture in today’s IT shops. They must seek to train or hire a more agile workforce and rethink the way agencies approach requirements at the time of solicitation. Like any other organizational change, none of this would be possible unless it is communicated as an agency- and government-wide imperative, and ultimately seen to fruition on a project-by-project and task-by-task level by the IT professionals that will be its daily shepherds.  Here are five steps that will lead in that direction: <!--more--></p>

<h2 id='1_rethinking_an_innovationaverse_culture'>1. Rethinking an innovation-averse culture</h2>

<p>Government agencies embody an entrenched culture of rigidly defined parameters, documentations, and overall, a meticulously defined hierarchical process. Uncertainty, and thus risk, is mitigated through policy that, by its very nature, resists change at all levels, especially a disruptive change like agile. Before any degree of agility can be injected into a stereotypically form-centric environment, managers must seek to create somewhat of a startup culture within their own business unit.</p>

<p>At the most basic level, it is not agencies that purchase IT for the government, but rather individuals on behalf of those agencies. Like their private-sector counterparts, care must be taken to ensure that these individuals’ incentives remain in line with those of their employer. Despite this, government budgeting continues to focus primarily on projects that fall within a single budget year, are controlled by a single budget program, and promise an easily predicted, low-risk return.</p>

<p>For example, contracting officer that adopts an innovative, but ultimately flawed approach may face reprimand or termination when presented with the technology’s underperformance, while without explicit financial incentives, gains little if the experiment proves beneficial. Put another way, <span class='pullquote'>federal employees are encouraged to avoid near-term risk and thus have a disincentive to improve well entrenched but outdated processes like waterfall</span>. New ideas must compete against proven ones, and all-too-often known problems take precedence over potential improvements. High-value, but high-risk ideas like agile require the kind of no-fault support from upper management that only a cultural shift can bring before they can begin to take foothold in the federal workplace.</p>

<h2 id='2_infusing_agile_knowledge_into_an_otherwise_waterfall_workforce'>2. Infusing agile knowledge into an otherwise waterfall workforce</h2>

<p>Across the board, federal employees, from contracting officers to in-house IT departments to agency CIOs, many of whom have risen through the ranks of primarily waterfall federal bureaucracies, are often not accustomed to managing an agile project, nor do they often find the necessary encouragement to take on such an endeavor. These federal employees, the front line of agile adoption, must be given the necessary toolset to properly contract and manage agile projects in an otherwise “over the fence” culture.</p>

<p>While many cities, Washington, D.C. especially, may offer agile training and certification, by-and-large federal employees seemingly do not take advantage of such opportunities. Like any industry, federal IT professionals at all levels must make a commitment to stay abreast of significant developments in their field. Project management has undergone a radical transformation in recent years. Whereas once mainframe computers and batch processing rendered change costly and thus an analogy to traditional engineering fields apropos, today cloud computing, commodity hardware, and the adoption of higher-level languages has created a more interactive development process that make mistakes made under an agile framework negligibly cheap. Yet this game-changing inflection point has yet to be fully appreciated by government, despite its widespread adoption in the private sector. Management must seek to infuse agility into the IT workforce either through continued education or strategic hiring at all levels.</p>

<h2 id='3_focusing_on_functional_rather_than_technical_requirements'>3. Focusing on functional, rather than technical requirements</h2>

<p>From a practical standpoint, to encourage agile adoption, solicitations and other formal documentation should outline functional, rather than technical requirements. Rather than specifying that a system use a particular encryption algorithm, for example, and thus risk that technology being obsolete or no longer needed at the time of delivery, requirements documentation should outline the functional goal that the agency really is after—in this case, industry-standard security practices. These requirements should be generated without the significant lead-time often seen in government procurement efforts and should involve all relevant stakeholders from the contracting officer to the technical point of contact and future system. An agile contract cannot be written from a waterfall mindset. The statement of work should specify high-level goals or systems (rather than specific features) that will eventually become the framework that defines each subsequent sprint. If necessary, the contract could include specific, functional milestones and accompanying deadlines, which may be married to an award schedule.</p>

<h2 id='4_making_innovation_an_imperative_at_all_levels'>4. Making innovation an imperative at all levels</h2>

<p>Like any push for organizational change, none of this can happen without significant, top-down support. First, federal opinion-leaders like the Office of Management and Budget must lean heavily on agencies to adopt more modern software development practices. Without significant political pressure both within an agency and between, reform will remain simply rhetorical. Tangible, specific guidance from the administration to agency CIOs and CFOs is necessary for innovation to overcome existing organizational inertia.</p>

<p>Second, relevant stakeholders within an agency must be empowered to take risks with, what is by government standards, a radically unconventional approach. Hierarchical status and paper forms—two staples of government—are antithetical to agile’s reliance on face-to-face informal communication. When responsibility lies in management, and thus is distinct from the actual development activity, such an approach inhibits the fast, authoritative decisions that are the hallmark of agile.</p>

<h2 id='5_applying_agiletoagile_adoption'>5. Applying agile-to-agile adoption</h2>

<p>It would be foolish to suggest that a transition to agile can happen on a government-wide or even agency level. Instead, like the processes it espouses, the push for agile should be iterative and rely almost exclusively on successive prototyping across business units. Individual projects, or even segments of individual projects, should be attempted using a fully agile framework, and slowly iterate through the agency’s efforts as subsequent development efforts learn from the evaluation of past sprints.</p>

<h2 id='beyond_technology'>Beyond Technology</h2>

<p>Government agility is not only important in so far as it helps agencies hit increasingly frugal budget targets, but also because when federal projects are not delivered on time and on budget agency objectives suffer. IT programs that cost more than they should or ultimately fail to meet agency needs, means the Department of Education helps fewer students, the Department of Health fosters cures for fewer patients, and the Department of Commerce creates fewer opportunities for the unemployed.</p>

<p>Technology has lapped the approach the federal government has traditionally taken to managing it. <span class='pullquote'>A highly entrenched, management-directed culture fatal to agile has taken foothold in the nation’s capital, and shows no signs of lessening</span>. Agencies must seek to build a workforce that understands and can embody the virtues of agile in their daily work. Functionality and the agency’s mission, not technology, should rule the workplace. None of this is possible, however, without significant pressure, both from the administration to agencies, and within agencies themselves, to make the shift to agile not only a priority, but a necessity of survival in today’s 21<sup>st</sup> century government. As the public’s scrutiny turns increasingly toward the federal budget, it is especially important that agencies are smarter about their development efforts and see them not as a line-item expense, but rather as a potential cost-saving innovation.</p>
