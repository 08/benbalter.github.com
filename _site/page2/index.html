Today, it powers <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/19/wordpress-now-powers-22-percent-of-new-active-websites-in-the-us/'>nearly a quarter of new sites</a>, and is the CMS of choice for<a href='http://trends.builtwith.com/cms'>more than two thirds of the top-million sites</a> on the web making it the world&#8217;s most popular publishing platform by a long shot. Yet one group of seemingly ideal users has been slow to take the former blogging platform seriously: .Govs.</p><p>Drupal powers twice as many federal .Govs <a href='http://dotgov.benbalter.com'>as every other CMS combined</a>. That&#8217;s more than six Drupal sites for every one WordPress .Gov alone, not to mention the Joomlas, MovableTypes, and SharePoints of the world. The build-it-yourself software powers the White House, the House of Representatives, half a dozen agencies, and countless data-driven microsites like Recovery.gov and the IT Spending Dashboard, and its public sector use is <a href='http://groups.drupal.org/node/19885'>equally if not more impressive abroad</a>.</p><h2 id='a_problem_of_perception'>A Problem of Perception</h2><h3 id='typical_enterprise_misconceptions'>Typical Enterprise Misconceptions</h3><ul>
<li>WordPress is a blogging platform</li>

<li>WordPress doesn&#8217;t scale well</li>

<li>Most plugins are written by hobbyists, not professionals</li>

<li>WordPress is less secure</li>

<li>WordPress can&#8217;t handle complex data types or user roles</li>

<li>There&#8217;s no enterprise support</li>

<li>There aren&#8217;t many WordPress developers</li>

<li>No &#8220;serious&#8221; people use WordPress</li>

<li>The WordPress codebase is immature</li>
</ul><p>WordPress&#8217;s disproportionately low government adoption is arguably the result of a handful of factors. For one, custom post types, the feature that formally graduated WordPress from a mere blogging platform into a full-fledged content management system, has only been around since June of last year. Yet, even among new sites, <sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> the ratio remains somewhat stagnant, if not shrinking, leaving one to believe that the technology has lapped its own already stellar perception.</p><p>When you stack the two side by side (or against any other CMS for that matter), WordPress is objectively the prudent choice. On paper, you&#8217;d be hard-pressed to make the case for anything else. But, it&#8217;s not a technical problem. It&#8217;s a human one. It seems that WordPress&#8217;s greatest asset – ease of use that has resulted in widespread adoption by a largely non-technical user base – is threatening to become its greatest liability.</p><p>Among those empowered to make purchasing decisions, there seems to be a sense that WordPress is what you use on the weekends to post pictures of your lunch while Drupal is what you use for &#8220;serious&#8221; business, and with good reason. For better or for worse, Drupal has positioned itself as not just a CMS, but rather <em>the</em> enterprise solution — an inseparable fifth layer of the increasingly ubiquitous enterprise LAMPD stack.</p><table><thead><tr><th /><th>Drupal</th><th>WordPress</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='text-align: left;'>API Hooks</td><td style='text-align: left;'><a href='http://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/includes--module.inc/group/hooks/8'>267</a></td><td style='text-align: left;'><a href='http://adambrown.info/p/wp_hooks/version/3.2'>1,506</a> (5x)</td>

</tr></tbody></table><h2 id='beyond_cowboy_coders'><strong>Beyond Cowboy Coders</strong></h2><p>Not surprisingly, the two communities are a reflection of their underlying software&#8217;s position in the broader market. CodePoet.com, for example, a directory of WordPress consultants curated by Automattic, lists <a href='http://codepoet.com/browse/regions/north-america/platforms/wordpress/project-size/250000-250000/'>a mere thirteen firms in North America that seek jobs over $250,000</a>(often a small price tag for government or corporate sites), while its Drupal counterpart lists roughly 80 firms that specifically target <a href='http://drupal.org/marketplace-preview/all/Government'>government</a>, <a href='http://drupal.org/marketplace-preview/all/Corporate'>enterprise</a>, and <a href='http://drupal.org/marketplace-preview/all/Non-Governmental-Organizations'>NGO clients</a> daily.</p><p>I am not suggesting that freelance developers should bring an end to what makes WordPress WordPress and change out of their shorts and sandals this instant or that they become intimately familiar with the nuances of federal procurement law, nor am I suggesting that small shops seek to bite off more than they can realistically chew anytime soon. I am suggestion, however, that there are small, tangible steps that the community can take to make headway into the government and enterprise space and gradually entrench WordPress as a viable alternative to otherwise subpar software harming innocent public servants.</p><h2 id='1_outdated_language'>1. <code>_Deprecate( ‘</code>Outdated Language<code>&#39; )</code></h2><p>The results of the recent WordPress survey suggest that the majority of sites use WordPress <em>as a CMS</em>. That&#8217;s like saying the majority of drivers use their Cadillac <em>as an automobile</em>. WordPress <em>is</em>a CMS. Yet, no one seems to be saying that. WordPress.org calls the software a &#8220;blog tool&#8221;, the WordPress Features codex page <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Features'>describes the site that the software creates as a &#8220;weblog&#8221; no less than 28 times</a>, <sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup> and the first search result for &#8220;WordPress CMS,&#8221; <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lastnode/Wordpress_CMS'>describes &#8220;what aspects of the WordPress… need to be changed in order to turn WordPress into a CMS.&#8221;</a></p><p>Especially in the buttoned-up context of corporate and government installs, &#8220;blog&#8221; can be a dirty word. Yet, to get the title of any site, the command we all still run is <code>get_bloginfo()</code>. Inside <code>&lt;?php</code> tags and out, the technology we have created has far outpaced the metaphor we use to describe it.</p><h2 id='2_make_new_friends'>2. Make New Friends</h2><p>In a typical procurement, be it a federal agency, mid-sized corporation, or local municipality, the CMS does not come first. In fact, many stakeholders wouldn&#8217;t know the site&#8217;s underlying technology if it weren&#8217;t for the logo on the login screen. A firm with a strong reputation in the industry is sought, and based largely on their recommendation, the technology – be it proprietary, open-source, or purpose-built – is chosen by evaluating each across a handful of metrics.</p><p>We all know the decision points. Performance and scaling, handing of complex data types, managing user roles, etc. All challenges that WordPress doesn&#8217;t even flinch at, yet the perception among the uninitiated is still widely that between open-source alternatives, WordPress is the least-accomplished in the bunch. Whether its reaching out and inviting nearby firms to your next meetup, giving a WordPress talk at a non-WordPress conference, or just being an exemplar in your local development community, we need to show the tie-wearing few in the conference room that you don&#8217;t have to be boring, overly complex, or unnecessarily expensive to get the job done right.</p><h2 id='3_but_wait_theres_more'>3. But Wait, There&#8217;s More…</h2><p>WordPress consultants are great at selling themselves, but rarely does anyone ever sell WordPress. Ask my why an agency or municipality should adopt Sharepoint, and I have page after page of <a href='http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/product/benefits/Pages/default.aspx'>focus-group tested material tailored to my industry</a>. Ask my why anyone should use WordPress, and <a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/09/01/why-wordpress/'>I&#8217;m pretty much left to fend for myself</a>. Somewhat counterintuitive in a world of free software, migrating to WordPress comes with significant costs that firms need to take into account, both real and imagined, costs that the technology&#8217;s ambassadors must actively overcome. Beyond actual development and training costs, there are perceived risks of an immature codebase, insecure plugins, and a general inability to do the job.</p><p>One of WordPress&#8217;s greatest strengths is its tight-nit cadre of dedicated enthusiasts. Yet it can often be hard for those on the inside to see things as those outside do. Think about those who have not yet tasted just how sweet the punch is. The name WordPress most often makes its way into a CIO&#8217;s inbox, for example, only when there&#8217;s been a security breach, not when there&#8217;s been a feature release. Where other platforms have stagnated, WordPress&#8217;s &#8220;can-do&#8221; attitude has forged onward introducing even more one-of-a-kind features, yet all too often they go unnoticed or underappreciated where it matters. Both collectively and individually, for WordPress to gain the respect of &#8220;the man,&#8221; we must seek to broadcast its excellence. Now is not the time for humility.</p><h2 id='4_build_serious_features_for_serious_users'>4. Build Serious Features for Serious Users</h2><p><a href='http://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/'>WordPress&#8217;s core philosophy</a> has always been to &#8220;code for the majority&#8221; and with the amount of customization required out-of-the-box to do just about anything, arguably Drupal&#8217;s philosophy has been &#8220;code for yourself.&#8221; While Automattic does a great job with <a href='http://en.wordpress.com/notable-users/'>the CNN&#8217;s and TechCrunch&#8217;s of the world</a>, there&#8217;s a huge opportunity here for developers to fill a void by giving rise to a new generation of core features, plugins, and themes with &#8220;serious&#8221; implementations in mind. Rather than another social media plugin, what&#8217;s the next big thing? Large-scale data? Geolocation? APIs and interoperability?</p><p>NASA&#8217;s space-race supercharching of the aerospace industry brought consumers everything from Super Soakers to sun glasses, and that same reach for the stars philosophy can put yet-unimagined power in the browsers of everyday WordPress users. Distraction free writing and an <em>even</em> more intuitive administrative interface are killer features to be sure, but they are the icing on an already beautiful cake and do little to gain parity with more traditional CMSs let alone take on the CMS space in the &#8220;WordPress Way.&#8221; A good example of this may be <a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/08/29/wp-document-revisions-document-management-version-control-wordpress/' title='WP Document Revisions — Document Management &amp; Version Control for WordPress'>WP Document Revisions</a>, a document management and workflow management tool built almost solely using core functionality. By leveraging WordPress&#8217;s core competencies, the venerable CMS can not only gain a seat at the adult&#8217;s table, but exponentially improve the experience for its primary user base as well</p><h2 id='frenemies'>Frenemies</h2><p>It&#8217;s important to note, though, it&#8217;s not a zero-sum game. Drupal doesn&#8217;t compete with WordPress like McDonalds does with Burger King or Coke with Pepsi. Government support for open-source software is a good thing, regardless of what form it takes. True, an infusion of publicly funded effort into the WordPress code base would invariably advance the software just as government funded research advances hard sciences, but, in the end, everybody wins here.</p><p>WordPress and government just make sense. As public institutions both large and small face growing budget concerns and begin to shift many of their services to the web, a platform like WordPress built with engagement, collaboration, and dialogue is the ideal fit, not to mention, incredibly persuasive when compared to expensive, propriety, or purpose-built alternatives.</p><h2 id='we_all_have_a_stake'><strong>We All Have a Stake</strong></h2><p>Whether WordPress is your primary source of income, a hobby, or just the thing that powers your personal site, we all have a stake in WordPress&#8217;s future. It is paramount that the community stays true to its scrappy roots. After all, there&#8217;s no sense selling the couch to buy a new TV. Yet, in order to be taken seriously by the public sector as a platform for more than simply sharing photos of kitten and chronicling teenage angst, we must first take ourselves seriously, and take baby steps to bring government adoption in line with the WordPress community&#8217;s otherwise unparalleled and well-deserved success.</p><p><a href='http://wpcandy.com/announces/quarterly-issue-one-ships'><img alt='' src='http://wpcandy.com/announces/quarterly-issue-one-ships' /></a> <em>This article originally printed in the <a href='http://wpcandy.com/announces/quarterly-issue-one-ships'>March, 2012 issue of The WPCandy Quarterly</a>.</em></p><p><strong><a href='http://wpcandy.com/quarterly'>Continue Reading →</a></strong><br />(subscription required)</p><p>Notes:</p><p><span />: http://ben.balter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/wordpress-in-government-ben-balter.png</p><div class='footnotes'><hr /><ol><li id='fn:1'>
<p><strong>Update (3/7):</strong> As many have pointed out, a lot of the misinformation may also be traced back to somewhat of a <em>decision lag</em>. Custom post types, custom taxonomies, and WordPress multisite — three key features that although minor from a technical standpoint, really served as the fundamental shift to transition the platform from <em>blog+</em> to <em>full-fledged CMS</em> — came about only three major versions ago (WordPress 3.0). While eighteen months may be an eternity for the vast majority of the technology sector (the iPad 1 had just barely launched eighteen months ago for comparison), in the Government space, <a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/11/29/towards-a-more-agile-government/'>procurement regulations dictate that such lag times are all but the norm</a>. As a result, in an already risk-averse contracting environment, we may actually be seeing numbers that more accurately reflect say, WordPress 2.9′s reception in the Government sector — a snapshot of when an agency chose a CMS at the onset of a multi-year procurement — rather than those that accurately reflect its technical capabilities today. <span>32</span></p>

      <p>PHP (and the open-source software it powers) often gets a bad rap in many government and enterprise circles, the brunt of such anecdotal cries as &#8220;it&#8217;s inherently insecure&#8221; or &#8220;X proprietary product is much safer.&#8221; The truth is, much of this unfortunate stereotype is the result of carefully crafted <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt'>fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD)</a>. An established disinformation tactic historically used by big names in software for decades, one of the most notorious instances of FUD being the leaked Microsoft &#8221;<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents'>Halloween Documents</a>&#8221; that outlined the software firm&#8217;s strategy to paint open-source, for example, as more costly or under-supported.</p><p>So is PHP secure? In a word: <strong>yes</strong>. In my mind, PHP&#8217;s ill-deserved reputation can be traced to three key causes (beyond mere proprietary propaganda):</p><ol>
<li><strong>It was</strong> - More than a decade ago, there was a legitimate argument to be made for PHP being insecure. It used to be that PHP shipped with a poorly thought out setting toggled on by default (that any coder worth their weight in Mountain Dew would toggle off) called <code>register_globals</code>. The setting allowed poorly written code to be short-circuited by passing certain parameters in the URL.  The default was flipped to off in 2000, and removed completely in 2009. End. Of. Story.</li>

<li><strong>It&#8217;s ubiquitous</strong> - Combine the traffic of Facebook, Wikipedia, and the White House, and you&#8217;ll have a good chunk of the Web&#8217;s traffic, not to mention probably a good chunk of the web&#8217;s attacks as a result. Saying that makes PHP insecure would logically render Microsoft Windows, the target of most viruses, equally insecure and unusable. It&#8217;s just a matter of numbers.</li>

<li><strong>It&#8217;s Forgiving</strong> – PHP is a very forgiving programming language, meaning it has a very gentle learning curve and is the first web language of choice for many budding developers. Naturally, inexperienced coders learning to code are going to write inexperienced and thus insecure code. Does that mean it&#8217;s insecure? No. Bad code is bad code in any language. Again, it&#8217;s a numbers game.</li>
</ol><p>It&#8217;s next to impossible to say a given language is &#8220;insecure.&#8221; That&#8217;d be like saying English, as a language, is less trustworthy. It just doesn&#8217;t make sense. In fact, most research supports the idea that the opposite is the case, that <a href='https://www.infoworld.com/d/open-source-software/report-open-source-tops-proprietary-code-in-quality-187169'>open-source produces better quality code than its closed-source counterparts</a>. Think about it <a href='http://www.commlawblog.com/2010/01/articles/unlicensed-operations-and-emer/fcc-changes-stance-on-opensource-security/'>this way</a>:</p><blockquote>
<p>Someone – let&#8217;s call him Bob – wants to secure a room. But in Bob&#8217;s universe, there are no locks. So Bob invents one, and installs it. And realizes he has a huge advantage over would-be intruders. Only Bob knows how the lock works. So no one else knows how to pick it. Bob sets about keeping his lock design a secret.</p>

<p>Alice also needs to secure a room, and she also invents a lock. Unlike Bob, though, Alice publishes her design – not the set-up for a particular key, of course, but the details of the overall mechanism.</p>

<p>Bob thinks Alice is nuts. Why tell people how your lock works? They&#8217;ll just pick it more easily.</p>

<p>Fine, says Alice, good luck keeping your design a secret. It&#8217;s going to get out, no matter what you do. And frankly, Bob, your lock probably isn&#8217;t all that great. Okay, neither is mine. Not yet. But now that it&#8217;s published, people will suggest improvements. Students will do Ph.D. dissertations on making it better. Companies will compete to develop stronger versions. And long after your design has leaked, and instructions for picking it are all over the Internet, my vastly improved lock will be far more secure. Even though everybody will know how it works.</p>
</blockquote><p>Put another way, unlike many of its commercial counterparts for which obfuscation is a security staple, open source relies on inherently sound security practices to ensure that whatever you want to remain private, remains private.</p><p>Last, because open-source projects like PHP are almost always monitored 24/7 by the prying eyes of countless developers scattered around the globe, if a vulnerability does arise, <a href='https://twitter.com/#!/nacin/status/9753986051604480'>it&#8217;s often addressed in hours</a>, and you&#8217;re not left waiting days or <a href='http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2008/03/07/delays-in-software-patch-pushed-security-firm-to-disclose-vmware-flaw/'>months as in some commercial products</a> for a patch from on high.</p><p>Is there insecure PHP code out there? No doubt. I&#8217;ve seen it. Does that mean all PHP is insecure? Far from it. Next time someone you know says something to the contrary, subtly mention in passing that you&#8217;re really surprised to hear that the company behind their favorite piece of commercial software recently announced they were sunsetting the project, and see how they handle a taste of their own FUD.</p><p>Notes:</p><ol>
<li>In simplified terms, if I have the variable $logged_in in my page to store whether a user is logged in or not, and I don&#8217;t first set it to false before checking, a visitor could go to mysite.com?logged_in=true, and the page would erroneously think I was logged in.</li>

    <div class="entrybody">
      <p>Wired Magazine recently took a turn for the meta. In addition to publishing <a href='http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/02/github/all/1'>their recent story featuring the popular version control site GitHub</a> on Wired.com as they would normally, they also <a href='https://github.com/WiredEnterprise/Lord-of-the-Files'>published it on GitHub itself under a creative commons license</a>, allowing readers to fork and contribute to the story as they saw fit. In <a href='http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/02/github-revisited/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+wired%2Findex+%28Wired%3A+Index+3+%28Top+Stories+2%29%29'>reflecting after the fact</a>, the Wired team said something that stood out to me:</p><blockquote>
<p>At Wired offices, you hear the question over and over again as we work on stories like the one you&#8217;re reading now: &#8220;Are you out of the story? I want to go in.&#8221; We have a version control problem. We publish Wired.com on WordPress. It&#8217;s a decent publishing tool, but when two people change a story at the same time, one of them doesn&#8217;t get her changes onto the final story.</p>

<p>We published our GitHub story on GitHub because it was meta-cool. But we also did it to see if GitHub might actually help us solve our problem.</p>
</blockquote><p>Spoiler alert: it didn&#8217;t. GitHub&#8217;s great for a lot of things, source code chief among them, but it&#8217;s not for the faint of heart. There&#8217;s a great deal of command line, and general geekery involved that raise the barriers to entry just high enough to keep it out of everyday newsrooms and editorial workflows. </p><p><strong>The Pitch:</strong>* What if we could re-imagine WordPress&#8217;s ease-of-use and intuitively dumb-simple workflow to introduce a layer of GitHub&#8217;s collaborative fork-and-merge horsepower under the hood? *</p><p>Users would have the ability to &#8220;clone&#8221; an existing post, make any changes they want, and then merge those change back into the original before publishing.There are four distinct use cases where this feature may come into play:</p><ul>
<li>Collaborative editing (by resolving two users&#8217; conflicted saves – Wired&#8217;s example)</li>

<li>Saving draft changes of already-published content</li>

<li>Scheduling pending changes to already-published content</li>

<li>Allowing users without edit or publish capabilities to edit and submit changes to content (similar to GitHub&#8217;s pull request system)</li>
</ul><p>I&#8217;d imagine the workflow would go something like this:</p><ol>
<li>User without the ability to edit an existing post has changes to make</li>

<li>User &#8220;forks&#8221; the post, making any change they deem necessary</li>

<li>When done, user attempts to merge changes back into the original</li>

<li>Post goes into standard WordPress &#8220;pending review&#8221; workflow</li>

<li>Editor is presented with diff (using the built-in diff engine), and can automatically accept changes (if there are no conflicts), or manually merge the two if necessary</li>

<li>Post is re-published with updated content, revision logs merged to reflect history</li>
</ol><p>In a nutshell:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Extends WordPress&#8217;s existing revision system</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Clone existing posts, edit, and &#8220;republish&#8221;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Schedule changes to posts, including taxonomies and metadata</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Pending changes diff view, front-end preview of changes</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Using WordPress&#8217;s pending-review system, integrates with existing plugins for notifications, management, etc.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Ability to store &#8220;commit messages&#8221; with each post revision to explain to others what changes were made and why</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Automatically merges (non-conflicted) changes (based on existing diff engine)</p>

<ol>
<li>One sided changes – one overwrites the other</li>

<li>Two sided non-conflict changes – automatically merge</li>

<li>Conflicted changes – note conflicts in fork and prepare for re-merge</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul><p>Post forking may make for a killer plugin  or piece of core functionality… and imagine if it could integrate with other collaboration tools like <a href='http://editflow.org/'>Edit Flow</a>, or <a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/08/29/wp-document-revisions-document-management-version-control-wordpress/'>WP Document Revisions</a>? As in Wired&#8217;s example, it has the potential to fundamentally change newsrooms and other editorial workflows. All of a sudden, any content becomes either publicly or privately collaborative. Pretty cool, huh? While it may be a bit ahead of it&#8217;s time from a human standpoint, from a technical standpoint, the technology&#8217;s there — it&#8217;s nothing new — just a matter of building it, and hopefully solving the dreaded &#8220;are you out yet?&#8221; problem.</p><p>Thoughts? Would you use this? What else would you like to see it do? <a href='http://ben.balter.com/contact/'>Drop me a line</a>, or let me know in the <a href='#comments'>comments below</a>?</p><p><strong>Update (3/5):</strong>The plan right now is to submit this as a <a href='http://ben.balter.com/tag/gsoc/'>Google Summer of Code</a> project, so if all goes well, look for the above-outlined functionality in a WordPress install near you towards the end of the summer. In the mean time, the continued thoughts/feedback is very greatly appreciated.</p><p><strong>Update (3/27):</strong>It looks like <a href='http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/2012/03/16/no-gsoc-2012/'>WordPress isn&#8217;t participating in GSoC this year</a>. Filing this idea under &#8220;someday&#8221;.</p><p><strong>Update (6/13):</strong>Stay tuned. This may yet become a reality after all. ETA end of summer-ish.</p><p>Notes:</p><ol>
<li>Having recently given this a try — using GitHub to curate <a href='http://ben.balter.com/2012/02/27/open-source-alternatives-to-proprietary-enterprise-software/'>a collaboratively edited list of open-source alternatives to proprietary software</a> — I know first-hand how off-putting GitHub can be to non-technical users. : Full disclosure: two plugins, <a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/revisionary/'>Revisionary</a> and <a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/duplicate-post/'>Duplicate Post</a> exist, but they don&#8217;t take the idea nearly as far as the above proposes, nor do they do it in &#8220;the WordPress way&#8221;. I&#8217;d hope that even if the idea started as a plugin, it would eventually be incorporated as core functionality. <span>16</span></li>

Conclusion</a></li></ul></div><p>Like many government computer systems, the U.S. federal information technology (IT) procurement model is slow, outdated, and long overdue for a reboot. <sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> As the largest single purchaser of code, <sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup> in fiscal year (FY) 2010 the Federal Government spent more than $77.1 billion on IT procurement, and that number is projected to grow higher by the close of 2011. <sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup> This is not a recent trend. Over the past decade, federal IT spending has swelled nearly seventy percent, up from $45.6 billion in 2001, <sup id='fnref:4'><a href='#fn:4' rel='footnote'>4</a></sup> for a total bill of more than $500 billion. <sup id='fnref:5'><a href='#fn:5' rel='footnote'>5</a></sup> This growth is partially a result of the unfortunate fact that as few as nine percent of projects are delivered on budget and on time. <sup id='fnref:6'><a href='#fn:6' rel='footnote'>6</a></sup> The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports that roughly forty-eight percent of all IT projects must be rebaselined, <sup id='fnref:7'><a href='#fn:7' rel='footnote'>7</a></sup> and of those rebaselined projects, fifty-one percent must be rebaselined a second time. <sup id='fnref:8'><a href='#fn:8' rel='footnote'>8</a></sup></p><p>Compounding the problem, end users fail entirely to use nearly forty-five percent of features procured and rarely use another nineteen percent of those features. <sup id='fnref:9'><a href='#fn:9' rel='footnote'>9</a></sup> Thus, purchasing agencies ultimately utilize only about one-third of all features paid for by American tax dollars. <sup id='fnref:10'><a href='#fn:10' rel='footnote'>10</a></sup> In the end, nearly forty-five percent of federally procured software features ultimately fail to meet the user&#8217;s needs. <sup id='fnref:11'><a href='#fn:11' rel='footnote'>11</a></sup> It is therefore no surprise that the Secretary of the Department of Defense (DoD) Robert Gates called federal IT procurement &#8220;baroque.&#8221; <sup id='fnref:12'><a href='#fn:12' rel='footnote'>12</a></sup> Too often IT procurement requirements are crafted with the input of neither end-users nor product developers. <sup id='fnref:13'><a href='#fn:13' rel='footnote'>13</a></sup> As Office of Management Budget (OMB) Director Peter R.

Agile offers contracting agencies less risk-avoidance upfront</h4><p>As a risk-avoidance measure, government contracting requires extensive reporting and detailed paper trails to accompany each step of the procurement process. <a href='#note-2020-114' title='Cheng, supra note 46.'>114</a> By integrating the contractor and contracting agency, agile development forces both to share the burden of risk. <a href='#note-2020-115' title='Id.

Current Regulations and Agency Practices Restrict Adoption of More Efficient Agile Methods</h2><p>Current procurement practices restrict the Government&#8217;s ability to adopt the agile model. The structure of the contracting process often conflicts with agile&#8217;s central tenants, and even if this basic incongruence is overcome, government contracting embodies a culture averse to agile.</p><h3 id='the-structure-of-traditional-government-contracting-is-not-amenable-to-agile-development-methods'>A. The Structure of Traditional Government Contracting is Not Amenable to Agile Development Methods</h3><p>For three reasons, government contracts are not written for agile. <a href='#note-2020-117' title='Cheng, supra note 46.'>117</a> First, as a matter of public policy, government contracting typically requires agencies to prefer competition at the cost of project deliverables. <a href='#note-2020-118' title='Sherman, supra note 15, at 3.'>118</a> Second, government programs generally involve significant lead times – forcing funding to be mapped out well in advance – rendering a &#8220;develop as you go&#8221; method counterintuitive. <a href='#note-2020-119' title='Cheng, supra note 46.'>119</a> Finally, most contract vehicles call for stable requirements, a method inherently incompatible with an adaptive model. <a href='#note-2020-120' title='Fowler, supra note 20.'>120</a></p><h3 id='government-procurement-embodies-a-culture-averse-to-agile-methodologies'>B. Government Procurement Embodies a Culture Averse to Agile Methodologies</h3><p>Government procurement embraces an entrenched culture of rigid parameters, documentation, and meticulously defined processes. <a href='#note-2020-121' title='Cheng, supra note 46 (commenting '>121</a> This manifests itself in several forms. For one, government budgeting focuses on projects that fall within a single budget year, are controlled by a single budget program, and promise an easily predicted, low-risk return. <a href='#note-2020-122' title='See Jerry Mechling &amp; Victoria Sweeney, Overcoming Budget Barriers: Funding IT Projects in The Public Sector 14 (1997'>122</a> Additionally, at the most basic level, it is not agencies who procure IT but rather individuals on behalf of those agencies. As in any sector, these individuals&#8217; incentives may not align with their employer&#8217;s goals. A CO who chooses an innovative but ultimately flawed contracting vehicle may face termination or reprimand, and without specific financial incentives, may gain nothing if the innovation proves beneficial. <a href='#note-2020-123' title='See id. at 8.'>123</a> Thus even if federal acquisition regulations on paper allow for agile development, in practice, COs have an incentive to avoid the near-term risk presented by innovation. <a href='#note-2020-124' title='See id.'>124</a> Third, new ideas must compete against proven ones and &#8220;urgent needs <span>&#8230;</span> take precedence over <span>future</span> possibilities.&#8221; <a href='#note-2020-125' title='Id. at 11.'>125</a> High-value but high-risk ideas like agile require support from upper management to take hold, and this support by-and-large does not exist. <a href='#note-2020-126' title='See id.'>126</a> Finally, across the board both COs and in-house IT departments are either unfamiliar with or unaccustomed to agile methods. <a href='#note-2020-127' title='Cheng, supra note 46.'>127</a> Before agile&#8217;s adoption, significant cultural reform and education must take place on both an organizational and an individual level.</p><h3 id='current-it-procurement-methods-are-not-amenable-to-agile-development'>C. Current IT Procurement Methods are Not Amenable to Agile Development</h3><p>Many IT contracting vehicles may exist in the context of any given project. While price-directed bids, competitive negotiations, conceptual negotiated sourcing, engineering selection, and modular contracting may provide some promise, no existing contracting vehicle is fully compatible with agile methodologies.</p><h4 id='price-directed-sealed-bid'>i. Price directed (sealed bid)</h4><p>Where bids are solicited and chosen solely based on cost, traditional acquisition takes the form of price-directed or sealed bid procurement. <a href='#note-2020-128' title='Sherman, supra note 15, at 230.'>128</a> This model does not accord with agile in that it requires precisely defined requirements in advance of solicitation. <a href='#note-2020-129' title='See id.; Emmett E. Hearn, Federal Acquisition and Contract Management 55 (5th ed. 2002'>129</a> Additionally, such technical requirements crowd out many private sector firms and spawn a government-specific industry that limits competition and available resources. <a href='#note-2020-130' title='Sherman, supra note 15, at 251.'>130</a></p><h4 id='competitive-negotiations'>ii. Competitive negotiations</h4><p>A negotiated procurement model allows contracting agencies to solicit proposals, similar to the price-directed model. <a href='#note-2020-131' title='See FAR Part 15.'>131</a> Unlike the price-directed model, however, bids are not sealed and agencies are permitted to discuss deficiencies with firms, which may then resubmit their bids.<a href='#_ftn133'><a href='#note-2020-131' title='See FAR Part 15.'>132</a></a> Nevertheless, the negotiated procurement model still requires the agency to outline technical specifications up front, making it incompatible with agile methods.</p><h4 id='technologyconceptual-negotiated-sourcing'>iii. Technology/Conceptual Negotiated Sourcing</h4><p>Technology or conceptual negotiated sourcing is a two-phase model. First the contracting agency awards the initial phase of design and conception to multiple competing bidders through multiple small-dollar, short-term contracts. <a href='#note-2020-132' title='Sherman, supra note 15, at 299-301.'>132</a> The agency then selects its preferred plan from among the submissions and continues with the procurement as if it were a sealed bid. <a href='#note-2020-133' title='Id. at 301.'>133</a> This approach is not ideal from an agile perspective, as it lengthens the time for which major resources are committed and delays prototyping until multiple firms can submit project plans. <a href='#note-2020-134' title='Id. at 302.'>134</a> This approach is also less efficient, as it forces the Government to fund parallel development and planning efforts. <a href='#note-2020-135' title='Id.'>135</a> For the federal IT procurement to better embrace innovation, change is needed.</p><h4 id='engineering-selection-under-the-brooks-act'>iv.

Significant Reform is Necessary to Allow Federal IT Procurement to Take Advantage of Industry Advances that Have Far Outpaced Laws Intended to Govern Them</h2><p>For the Federal Government to become more agile, three distinct but parallel initiatives are necessary. First, COs and technical representatives must be educated as to the best practices for implementing agile in government contracting. Second, statutory requirements encouraging agencies into waterfall frameworks by demanding extensive requirements documentation pre-award should be avoided through alternative contracting vehicles. Finally, even if permitted by law, proponents must garner significant top-down support from within their agencies for agile practices to be accepted.</p><h3 id='cos-and-cotrs-require-education-before-agile-can-be-introduced-to-the-federal-contracting-environment'>A. COs and COTRs Require Education Before Agile Can be Introduced to the Federal Contracting Environment</h3><p>Before federal IT procurement can embrace agile methodologies, best-practices education is required on two levels.

The statement of work should specify high-level goals or systems, rather than specific features, and these goals should eventually become the framework that defines each subsequent sprint.

COs Lack Top-Down Support for IT Procurement Reform</h3><p>The above goals cannot be realized without significant top-down support from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, OMB, and Chief Technology Officers at each agency. COs must be empowered to take risks with such an unconventional approach. While top administration officials have made statements supporting an agile approach to IT procurement reform, such rhetoric remains noncommittal. Tangible, specific guidance from senior administration officials to agency CIOs and CFOs must occur in order for innovation to succeed.</p><h2 id='conclusion'>VI. Conclusion</h2><p>The federal IT procurement system is outdated. Projects are consistently delivered late, over-budget, and obsolete. Much of this trend can be traced back to flawed legal frameworks that lock agencies and contractors into an outdated development model. Through education, reform, and organization-wide support, federal agility can become a reality. Any computer user knows that as systems age they begin to slow. Today, the federal IT procurement system is running slowly, to the detriment of both agencies and the public, and it is long overdue for a system-wide upgrade.</p><p><a href='http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/'><img alt='Creative Commons License' src='http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/' /></a></p><p><em>Originally published in The Public Contract Law Journal, Volume 41, Issue 1.

Today, however, advances in technology and the personal computer have allowed the software development environment to embody an interactive process whereby software engineers can receive immediate feedback as to their software&#8217;s success or failure. <em>Id.</em>at 218-19 (noting that originally high computing costs drove up the cost of mistakes such that &#8220;rigid disciplines ruled.&#8221; Today, mistakes are cheap.). <span>187</span></p>

<p>A detailed explanation of the evolution to a service-oriented architecture is beyond the scope of this Note, but in simple terms, if one thinks of information as a product, the evolution mimics the move from individual manufacturers producing a good, to a factory producing a good, to that factory adopting an assembly line approach. A government agency might build a system once, (e.g. an application to calculate the appropriate census block based on a given address,) and then will have subsequent systems query that already-built application, rather than duplicate the functionality. Any given request for information may go through five, ten, perhaps even a hundred systems, each of which can be procured or upgraded individually.

Engineers building bridges rely on well-established laws of physics supported by the fundamentals of mathematics, two sciences that are rigidly defined and easily relied upon. Software development, on the other hand, is not bound by the rules of the physical world. Gravity, an assumed constant in engineering, has relatively little relevance to programming. <span>213</span></p>

This would be easy if you had no opponent. When the other team begins moving forward there&#8217;s no way to &#8230; know how to optimally get to the other side, and waterfall software development expects just that.

<p>A prime example of such a phenomenon is the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). In 1983 the PTO initiated a billion-dollar automation effort using waterfall. At the time the PTO&#8217;s patent files contained some thirty-three million documents, supporting patents issued since 1790, and grew at the rate of approximately one million documents per year. The goal was to have a fully deployed system by 1990, however by 1987, the PTO began to realize that the program was fatally behind schedule and switched to an agile approach. Course Manual , <em>supra</em> note 28, at 66-67<strong>.</strong>The PTO was able to successfully deploy its patent search system (CSIR) later that year, and by 1992 had a significant portion of its automation system integrated into its workflow.

Hackers, cyber terrorists, and other malcontents are not bound by the rigidity of waterfall and are often able to adapt more rapidly to government countermeasures than the Government can develop defenses. <em>See</em> Federal Executive Roundtable, <em>supra</em>note 56. Similarly, after spending nearly two years and 0 million dollars developing handheld computers for use in conjunction with the 2010 census, the U.S. Census Bureau was forced to drop its plans and revert to paper-based collection when it realized the waterfall approach it had adopted would not deliver a working system in time for the census data collection.

      <p>Never before has it been so vital that the federal government do more with less. On all sides of the National Mall, government agencies are tightening their belts considerably, but the challenge is not simply about trimming budgets or spending less. In many cases, the problem is a matter of spending smarter.</p><h3 id='what_is_agile'>What is Agile?</h3><ul>
<li>An incremental approach to software development that breaks a project into many independent, fungible tasks;</li>

<li>Does not seek to build software in a sequential, step-wise manner;</li>

<li>Recognizes the reality that requirements are unpredictable and change over time; and</li>

<li>Plans are continuously inspected and adapted through rapid prototyping.</li>
</ul><p>While the federal IT infrastructure is beginning to show its age — loosing its ability to serve federal employees and thus more broadly the American public — federal approaches to IT procurement and management are increasingly proving themselves to be equally anachronistic. Traditional heavyweight philosophies known most commonly as waterfall development simply move too slowly for today&#8217;s quickly changing federal IT landscape. By the time projects reach completion, all too often, the technology or the customer&#8217;s needs have fundamentally changed, and what is delivered does not resemble what is needed. If we wish to create the efficient government of the 21st century, we must jettison traditional approaches to IT project management and adopt a more agile model.</p><h2 id='technology_that_outpaces_the_laws_that_govern_its_adoption'>Technology that Outpaces the Laws that Govern its Adoption</h2><p>Government contracts are rarely written for agile, and with good reason: As a matter of public policy, procurement regulations force agencies to prefer full and open competition over sound project deliverables. By purposeful design, federal procurement emphasizes the process surrounding the purchase, not on the purchase itself. Traditional contracting vehicles call for stable requirements to be outlined up front and rigidly adhered to, regardless of advancements in technology or changes to the agency&#8217;s needs. Compounding the problem, contracting officers must often secure and commit funding well in advance, rendering adaptation impossible and Agile&#8217;s &#8221;I&#8217;ll know it when I see it&#8221; approach, somewhat counterintuitive. Finally, due to the significant administrative cost presented to the agency, these restrictions encourage agency-wide transformations to be approached in a large, single pass rather than addressing the component parts individually. These procedural necessities — not usually seen in the private sector — generate significant lead times further hindering agencies&#8217; adoption of any approach that relies on small iterations.</p><h3 id='federal_it_procurement_by_the_numbers'>Federal IT Procurement by the Numbers:</h3><ul>
<li><strong>77.1</strong> – amount in billions the federal government spent on IT in FY2010</li>

<li><strong>70</strong> – percent increase in federal IT spending over the past decade</li>

<li><strong>1/3</strong> – procured features actually used by the agencies that contract them</li>

<li><strong>9</strong> – percentage of federal IT projects delivered on budget and on time</li>
</ul><p>These potential stumbling blocks, however, do not necessarily prove fatal. Compared to organizational culture, laws are easy to change given enough pressure by those they govern. Ironically, this seemingly technological challenge is, most elementally, a human one. Federal stakeholders must actively rethink the predominant culture in today&#8217;s IT shops. They must seek to train or hire a more agile workforce and rethink the way agencies approach requirements at the time of solicitation. Like any other organizational change, none of this would be possible unless it is communicated as an agency- and government-wide imperative, and ultimately seen to fruition on a project-by-project and task-by-task level by the IT professionals that will be its daily shepherds. Here are five steps that will lead in that direction:</p><h2 id='1_rethinking_an_innovationaverse_culture'>1. Rethinking an innovation-averse culture</h2><p>Government agencies embody an entrenched culture of rigidly defined parameters, documentations, and overall, a meticulously defined hierarchical process. Uncertainty, and thus risk, is mitigated through policy that, by its very nature, resists change at all levels, especially a disruptive change like agile. Before any degree of agility can be injected into a stereotypically form-centric environment, managers must seek to create somewhat of a startup culture within their own business unit.</p><p>At the most basic level, it is not agencies that purchase IT for the government, but rather individuals on behalf of those agencies. Like their private-sector counterparts, care must be taken to ensure that these individuals&#8217; incentives remain in line with those of their employer. Despite this, government budgeting continues to focus primarily on projects that fall within a single budget year, are controlled by a single budget program, and promise an easily predicted, low-risk return.</p><p>For example, contracting officer that adopts an innovative, but ultimately flawed approach may face reprimand or termination when presented with the technology&#8217;s underperformance, while without explicit financial incentives, gains little if the experiment proves beneficial. Put another way, federal employees are encouraged to avoid near-term risk and thus have a disincentive to improve well entrenched but outdated processes like waterfall. New ideas must compete against proven ones, and all-too-often known problems take precedence over potential improvements. High-value, but high-risk ideas like agile require the kind of no-fault support from upper management that only a cultural shift can bring before they can begin to take foothold in the federal workplace.</p><h2 id='2_infusing_agile_knowledge_into_an_otherwise_waterfall_workforce'>2. Infusing agile knowledge into an otherwise waterfall workforce</h2><p>Across the board, federal employees, from contracting officers to in-house IT departments to agency CIOs, many of whom have risen through the ranks of primarily waterfall federal bureaucracies, are often not accustomed to managing an agile project, nor do they often find the necessary encouragement to take on such an endeavor. These federal employees, the front line of agile adoption, must be given the necessary toolset to properly contract and manage agile projects in an otherwise &#8220;over the fence&#8221; culture.</p><p>While many cities, Washington, D.C. especially, may offer agile training and certification, by-and-large federal employees seemingly do not take advantage of such opportunities. Like any industry, federal IT professionals at all levels must make a commitment to stay abreast of significant developments in their field. Project management has undergone a radical transformation in recent years. Whereas once mainframe computers and batch processing rendered change costly and thus an analogy to traditional engineering fields apropos, today cloud computing, commodity hardware, and the adoption of higher-level languages has created a more interactive development process that make mistakes made under an agile framework negligibly cheap. Yet this game-changing inflection point has yet to be fully appreciated by government, despite its widespread adoption in the private sector. Management must seek to infuse agility into the IT workforce either through continued education or strategic hiring at all levels.</p><h2 id='3_focusing_on_functional_rather_than_technical_requirements'>3. Focusing on functional, rather than technical requirements</h2><p>From a practical standpoint, to encourage agile adoption, solicitations and other formal documentation should outline functional, rather than technical requirements. Rather than specifying that a system use a particular encryption algorithm, for example, and thus risk that technology being obsolete or no longer needed at the time of delivery, requirements documentation should outline the functional goal that the agency really is after—in this case, industry-standard security practices. These requirements should be generated without the significant lead-time often seen in government procurement efforts and should involve all relevant stakeholders from the contracting officer to the technical point of contact and future system. An agile contract cannot be written from a waterfall mindset. The statement of work should specify high-level goals or systems (rather than specific features) that will eventually become the framework that defines each subsequent sprint. If necessary, the contract could include specific, functional milestones and accompanying deadlines, which may be married to an award schedule.</p><h2 id='4_making_innovation_an_imperative_at_all_levels'>4. Making innovation an imperative at all levels</h2><p>Like any push for organizational change, none of this can happen without significant, top-down support. First, federal opinion-leaders like the Office of Management and Budget must lean heavily on agencies to adopt more modern software development practices. Without significant political pressure both within an agency and between, reform will remain simply rhetorical. Tangible, specific guidance from the administration to agency CIOs and CFOs is necessary for innovation to overcome existing organizational inertia.</p><p>Second, relevant stakeholders within an agency must be empowered to take risks with, what is by government standards, a radically unconventional approach. Hierarchical status and paper forms—two staples of government—are antithetical to agile&#8217;s reliance on face-to-face informal communication. When responsibility lies in management, and thus is distinct from the actual development activity, such an approach inhibits the fast, authoritative decisions that are the hallmark of agile.</p><h2 id='5_applying_agiletoagile_adoption'>5. Applying agile-to-agile adoption</h2><p>It would be foolish to suggest that a transition to agile can happen on a government-wide or even agency level. Instead, like the processes it espouses, the push for agile should be iterative and rely almost exclusively on successive prototyping across business units. Individual projects, or even segments of individual projects, should be attempted using a fully agile framework, and slowly iterate through the agency&#8217;s efforts as subsequent development efforts learn from the evaluation of past sprints.</p><h2 id='beyond_technology'>Beyond Technology</h2><p>Government agility is not only important in so far as it helps agencies hit increasingly frugal budget targets, but also because when federal projects are not delivered on time and on budget agency objectives suffer. IT programs that cost more than they should or ultimately fail to meet agency needs, means the Department of Education helps fewer students, the Department of Health fosters cures for fewer patients, and the Department of Commerce creates fewer opportunities for the unemployed.</p><p>Technology has lapped the approach the federal government has traditionally taken to managing it. A highly entrenched, management-directed culture fatal to agile has taken foothold in the nation&#8217;s capital, and shows no signs of lessening. Agencies must seek to build a workforce that understands and can embody the virtues of agile in their daily work. Functionality and the agency&#8217;s mission, not technology, should rule the workplace. None of this is possible, however, without significant pressure, both from the administration to agencies, and within agencies themselves, to make the shift to agile not only a priority, but a necessity of survival in today&#8217;s 21st century government. As the public&#8217;s scrutiny turns increasingly toward the federal budget, it is especially important that agencies are smarter about their development efforts and see them not as a line-item expense, but rather as a potential cost-saving innovation.</p><p><em>This article originally published in <a href='http://www.governmentciomagazine.com/'>Government CIO Magazine</a>.</em></p><p><strong><a href='http://www.governmentciomagazine.com/2011/11/federal-agility-adopting-cultural-approach-technical-problem#blog-content'>Continue reading →</a></strong></p>

      <p>As Aaron Shapiro over at Fast Company <a href='http://www.fastcompany.com/1779120/embargo-1027-why-digital-talent-doesn-t-want-to-work-at-your-company'>cogently argues</a>, &#8221;<em>it&#8217;s because you&#8217;re not providing them the right opportunity. The talent you want would be happy to work in an un-air-conditioned garage in New Mexico if it meant the chance to change the world</em>.&#8221;</p><p>Specifically he points out:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Every element of their work will be pored over by multiple layers of bureaucracy.</strong> Even if that&#8217;s how the rest of the company operates, it can&#8217;t spill into the digital department. In a technology environment, new products and businesses spring up daily and a new endeavor can go from conception to launch in a matter of months. Reining in the momentum will be read as inaction and a clear signal the company isn&#8217;t willing to grasp the new way of the world.</li>

<li><strong>Mediocre is good enough.</strong> While clocking out at 5 p.m. is attractive to some, it will discourage digital talent. They want to be expected to do something great. They want to be pushed. They care about their work. Their leadership, and those they rely on to get things done, must match their appetite for success.</li>

<li><strong>Trial and error is condemned.</strong> The freedom to try out new ideas allows employees to take initiative, make decisions, and learn from their mistakes. It also demonstrates an attractive and inspiring entrepreneurial spirit.</li>

<li><strong>Your company is structured so it takes a lifetime to get to the top, and as such there are no digital experts in company-wide leadership positions.</strong>Digital talent–often in their 20s and 30s–need to see a clear path for uninhibited career development that&#8217;s based on merit, not years spent, and that&#8217;s beyond the confines of the digital department. If they don&#8217;t, they won&#8217;t see a reason to stay with the company in the long term.</li>

<li><strong>Your offices are cold, impersonal and downright stodgy.</strong> It may sound like it conflicts with the &#8220;you don&#8217;t need to be in Silicon Valley point,&#8221; but appreciate the nuance. A traditional office layout is designed to communicate power among certain individuals and barriers between departments. This does not support the collaborative ethos which is intrinsic to the web. Companies should do everything possible to provide the digital team friendlier, open office space. A location in a hip, young neighborhood (which surely exists in every mid- to large-sized city) is also a big plus.</li>
</ul><p>I think the argument could be extended to hiring 20-somethings more broadly (<a href='http://www.nextgov.com/nextgov/ng_20100423_7313.php'>I&#8217;m looking at your Federal Government</a>), but a great read, nonetheless.</p><p><span>via <a href='http://www.fastcompany.com/1779120/embargo-1027-why-digital-talent-doesn-t-want-to-work-at-your-company'>Fast Company</a></span></p>

      <p>Looking for even more advanced control of your workflow? <a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/08/29/wp-document-revisions-document-management-version-control-wordpress/' title='WP Document Revisions — Document Management &amp; Version Control for WordPress'>WP Document Revisions</a>gained a huge feature today with the addition of integrated support for the popular workflow plugin <a href='http://editflow.org'>Edit Flow</a>. Beginning with <a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-document-revisions/'>version 1.1</a>, WP Document Revisions will detect Edit Flow, if installed, and will automatically pull <a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/edit-flow/screenshots/'>Edit Flow&#8217;s advanced workflow management tools</a> into the proven WP Document Revisions experience you already know and use. Specifically:</p><p>**<br />**</p><ul>
<li><strong>E-Mail Notifications and User Groups</strong> allow you to keep track of activity via e-mail and manage alerts based on existing teams. Subscribe individual users or entire groups to receive a document&#8217;s updates.</li>

<li><strong>Custom Document Metadata</strong> allows organizations to store additional information alongside your documents in a sleek, intuitive manner. Supports a virtually unlimited number of checkboxes, dates, locations, text, users, and numeric fields.</li>

<li><strong>Collaborative Team Chat</strong>allows users to comment on and discuss individual documents, pulling the conversation out of your inbox and back into your workflow.</li>

<li><strong>Evolved Workflow State Integration</strong> allows for more granular control of Workflow states (&#8220;Document Status&#8221; in EditFlow parlance), including setting a document&#8217;s initial status and better integration with the native WordPress experience.</li>

<li><strong>Advanced Snapshots</strong> of your team&#8217;s progress via filterable calendar and budget views. See all documents in a particular step in your workflow, in a particular category, in a particular week, or by a particular user.</li>
</ul><p>Ideal for teams of any size looking to fine tune their WP Document Revisions experience without the hassle of <a href='https://github.com/benbalter/WP-Document-Revisions-Code-Cookbook'>coding a custom implementation</a>, the addition of Edit Flow support offers a unique suite of powerful and intuitive workflow management tools right out of the box.</p><p>Want one feature but not another? Each can be individually enabled or disabled via Edit Flow&#8217;s settings panel. For more information, see the <a href='http://editflow.org/'>Edit Flow homepage</a> or simply <a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/edit-flow/'>download and install the plugin</a> to begin — no additional setup necessary.</p>

      <p>The White House&#8217;s Office of Management and Budget recently released a<a href='http://explore.data.gov/Federal-Government-Finances-and-Employment/Federal-Executive-Branch-Internet-Domains/k9h8-e98h'>list of all domains</a> owned and operated by federal executive agencies. Leveraging a previous tool I had built called <a href='https://github.com/benbalter/Site-Inspector'>Site Inspector</a> which provides information about a domain and its technical capabilities, I imported the list into the content management system WordPress, and created a plugin called <a href='https://github.com/benbalter/Domain-Inventory'>Domain Inventory</a>to scan each domain and curate the results. A summary of my preliminary results appears below, as well as a link to the browsable dataset.</p><p><strong>The project tracks each Federal Executive .Gov by:</strong></p><ul>
<li><strong>Agency</strong>(as provided in the data.gov list)</li>

<li><strong>Server status</strong> (response code, if it is reachable, etc.)</li>

<li><strong>Non-WWW support</strong> (is www. required to access the site)</li>

<li><strong>IPv6 Support</strong> (is it reachable via next generation technology)</li>

<li><strong>CDN Provider</strong> (do they use a content distribution network, if so what)</li>

<li><strong>CMS</strong> (do they use a content management system, if so what)</li>

<li><strong>Cloud Provider</strong> (are they hosted in the cloud, if so by whom)</li>

<li><strong>Analytics Source</strong> (do they track visitors, if so how)</li>

<li><strong>Script Library</strong> (do they use common javascript libraries)</li>

<li><strong>HTTPs Support</strong> (is the site browsable via the secure HTTPS protocol)</li>
</ul><p><strong>Key Highlights of the Preliminary Results:</strong></p><ul>
<li>Only 73% of domains are <a href='http://dotgov.benbalter.com/status/live/'>live and in use</a></li>

<li><em>Of live domains</em> 80% are accessible <a href='http://dotgov.benbalter.com/nonwww/yes/'>without typing the www. prefix</a>.</li>

<li>Only 10 sites fully support the federally mandated <a href='http://dotgov.benbalter.com/ipv6/yes/'>IPv6 standard</a>.</li>

<li>87 domains use the <a href='http://dotgov.benbalter.com/cdn/akamai/'>Akamai</a> content distribution network.</li>

<li>12 are believed to be in the cloud, including 10 in <a href='http://dotgov.benbalter.com/cloud/amazon/'>Amazon</a>, and 2 in <a href='http://dotgov.benbalter.com/cloud/rackspace/'>Rackspace</a>.</li>

<li>103 use some form of analytics, with <a href='http://dotgov.benbalter.com/analytics/google-analytics/'>Google Analytics</a> being the most popular, found on 86 domains.</li>

<li>Drupal is<a href='http://dotgov.benbalter.com/cms/drupal/'>by far the most popular CMS</a>, powering nearly twice as many domains as all other CMSs combined.</li>

<li><a href='http://dotgov.benbalter.com/cms/wordpress/'>WordPress</a> is the second most popular primary CMS (17), followed by Microsoft <a href='http://dotgov.benbalter.com/cms/sharepoint/'>SharePoint</a> (13).</li>

<li>93% of <em>live</em> domains use <a href='http://dotgov.benbalter.com/cms/none/'>no detectable CMS</a>, or use a custom-built solution.</li>
</ul><p>Slightly more than half of live servers are powered by</p><p><a href='http://dotgov.benbalter.com/server_software/commercial/'>commercial software.</a></p><p><strong>The full, browsable dataset:<a href='http://dotgov.benbalter.com'>http://dotgov.benbalter.com</a></strong></p><p><em>Please note: This data is to be treated as preliminary and is provided &#8220;as is&#8221; with no guarantee as to its validity. The source code for all tools used, including the resulting data, is available in <a href='https://github.com/benbalter/Domain-Inventory'>GitHub</a>. If you find a systemic error, I encourage you to fork the code and I will try my best to recrawl the list to improve the data&#8217;s accuracy.</em></p><p><strong>Update (10/4)</strong>: Updated the above statistics (and underlying data) based on an updated domain list published on data.gov and recrawled using the same tools. The above numbers now use the number of <em>live</em> sites (rather than total number of domains) as the denominator for percentages, and excludes approximately 300 domains which simply redirects to other .govs.</p>
