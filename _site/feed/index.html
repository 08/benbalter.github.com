        <content>&lt;p&gt;A petition was recently posted on &lt;a href='https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/'&gt;We The People&lt;/a&gt; demanding &lt;a href='https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/maximize-public-benefit-federal-technology-sharing-government-developed-software-under-open-source/6n5ZBBwf?utm_source=wh.gov&amp;amp;utm_medium=shorturl&amp;amp;utm_campaign=shorturl'&gt;that federally funded software be released under an open source license&lt;/a&gt;. Makes sense. The public should have access to what is technically their property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href='http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120723/12181319800/should-software-created-federal-govt-be-open-source-licensed-public-domain.shtml'&gt;TechDirt posed the question&lt;/a&gt; of whether it should be released under an open-source license or public domain, and I&amp;#8217;m afraid they really missed the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s no doubt in my mind that the creator of the petition was simply asking the question &amp;#8220;I can haz source code?&amp;#8221; Plain and simple. Put it in context: 99% of the time when an organization (or an individual) releases software to the public, they do so under the terms of an open source license. It tells users what they can and can&amp;#8217;t do, and tells contributors under what terms they can contribute. It&amp;#8217;s set&amp;#8217;s the ground rules. It&amp;#8217;s a contract with the public. It&amp;#8217;s a prenup for code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#8217;s the issue? Although I generally dread the phrase, in this case, government is objectively different. Under 17 U.S.C ยง 105 US Government Works are not subject to domestic copyright protection. It&amp;#8217;s not technically public domain, but it&amp;#8217;s close enough. &lt;sup id='fnref:1'&gt;&lt;a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Any US citizen can use the code any way they wish. There&amp;#8217;s simply no copyright, thus no need to license. &lt;sup id='fnref:2'&gt;&lt;a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; And this entire debate is a moot point if the software is a derivative work of a viral license like the GPL, the most common open source license. &lt;sup id='fnref:3'&gt;&lt;a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That of course, only applies to code created by a US government employee, an increasingly rare occurrence. &lt;sup id='fnref:4'&gt;&lt;a href='#fn:4' rel='footnote'&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Absent permission from the contracting officer, the US government retains unlimited rights for all work created under contract (including the right to redistribute). &lt;sup id='fnref:5'&gt;&lt;a href='#fn:5' rel='footnote'&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; And again a moot point if GPL derivative (and thus must be given to the Government under the GPL.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet all this is very academic (not to mention dry). Waldo Jaquith and Anil Dash &lt;a href='https://twitter.com/anildash/statuses/227476701599391744'&gt;made a great suggestion&lt;/a&gt;: let&amp;#8217;s be pragmatic here. Government doesn&amp;#8217;t hold on to software because they are concerned about licensing. They hold on to software because they have better things to do, because it&amp;#8217;s not within the culture, and because there&amp;#8217;s no angry mob slamming a battering ram against the metaphorical front gates when they don&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think the nuances of federal procurement law is even close to the first thing we should care about here. &lt;sup id='fnref:6'&gt;&lt;a href='#fn:6' rel='footnote'&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The concern is about whether feds should do the leg work to open source it or not. The question for us as developers, for the thought leaders in the space, isn&amp;#8217;t how should the US government best license / not license software, but* how can the open source community help it to* * do so.* How can we get more software out the door? In a world of finite time, &lt;em&gt;how can we make open sourcing&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup id='fnref:7'&gt;&lt;a href='#fn:7' rel='footnote'&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;em&gt;a bonafide priority&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How? For one, involvement in existing open source projects &lt;sup id='fnref:8'&gt;&lt;a href='#fn:8' rel='footnote'&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; would surely send a strong message that there&amp;#8217;s latent demand here, and would give the foot soldiers political air cover to forge onward with their efforts. For another, taking ownership of the code itself, and realizing it is &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; code, not the government&amp;#8217;s would surely change the tone of the debate by encouraging agencies to ship code sooner, rather than delaying release out of fear of criticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, it&amp;#8217;s about what role we are going to play, not what rights we are going to receive. Let&amp;#8217;s at least get the source code, then we can go back to our regularly scheduled holy wars over licensing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As always, &lt;a href='http://ben.balter.com/fine-print/'&gt;views are my own&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='footnotes'&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li id='fn:1'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d argue that all software, even government funded software should still be licensed under a traditional open source license, to resolve any legal ambiguity when used abroad under the terms of various international copyright treaties and agreements &lt;span&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href='#fnref:1' rev='footnote'&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id='fn:2'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although citizen-contributions to that project would theoretically not be public domain, thus necessitating a license, which should be clarified in the project&amp;#8217;s documentation at the time of release to avoid potential issues with 21 U.S.C. ยง 1342. &lt;span&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href='#fnref:2' rev='footnote'&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id='fn:3'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although again, technically speaking the project as a whole would be licensed under GPL, individual code not dependent on the parent project could be used as a US Government Work. &lt;span&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href='#fnref:3' rev='footnote'&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id='fn:4'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you&amp;#8217;re looking at the &lt;a href='https://github.com/languages/ColdFusion'&gt;vibrant open source cold fusion community&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href='#fnref:4' rev='footnote'&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id='fn:5'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FAR 52.227-14(c)(1)(i). Even if the contracting officer grants such rights, they do not take effect unless the contractor includes a copyright notice at the time of delivery, acknowledging the government&amp;#8217;s sponsorship and indicating the contract number under which it was procured. See FAR 27.404(a)(5). &lt;span&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href='#fnref:5' rev='footnote'&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id='fn:6'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General counsels across government already have enough ammunition to stymy progress. &lt;span&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href='#fnref:6' rev='footnote'&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id='fn:7'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often the last and least seen step in the enterprise development process &lt;span&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href='#fnref:7' rev='footnote'&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id='fn:8'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s been &lt;a href='http://ben.balter.com/2012/04/15/cfpb-accepts-first-citizen-submitted-pull-request-on-behalf-of-federal-government/'&gt;exactly one pull request to date&lt;/a&gt; across all government github repos &lt;span&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href='#fnref:8' rev='footnote'&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

        <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/07/spring-cleaning-in-summer.html'&gt;&lt;img alt='' src='http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/07/spring-cleaning-in-summer.html' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I was recently asked how I would architect a personalized dashboard experience for visitors to a large, customer-facing website. My response? &lt;em&gt;I wouldn&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dashboard in a car or airplane makes sense. It&amp;#8217;s not as if I could click &amp;#8220;speedometer&amp;#8221; while driving or press the &amp;#8220;altimeter&amp;#8221; button while flying. I simply need everything at all times. But virtual interfaces don&amp;#8217;t have that same limitation. In fact they don&amp;#8217;t have any limitations. A dashboard can have as much information as the most ambitious engineer can dream โ and that&amp;#8217;s exactly the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put it in context: Google&lt;a href='http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/07/spring-cleaning-in-summer.html'&gt;recently announced the retirement of iGoogle&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s own personalized dashboard, and I second their nomination to induct dashboards into the #doingitwrong hall of fame, joining the likes of internet portals, splash pages, and well, basically anything involving ActiveX or Flash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dashboard were a fun user interface experiment. They really were, especially compared to the static pages they evolved from. That was the whole point of Web 2.0, wasn&amp;#8217;t it? Personalization? I mean, it was really cool to drag and drop widgets, and build a virtual command center to monitor my little corner of the internet, and that was fine when there wasn&amp;#8217;t much internet out there to monitor. But the web collectively hit a tipping point a few years back. From push notifications to always-on e-mail, in more ways than we imagine, we now bombard ourselves with more information that we can physically process at any given moment. &lt;a href='http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/retina-display.html'&gt;Quite literally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it this way: when customers come to a website, they&amp;#8217;re not looking to solve 10 problems. They&amp;#8217;re looking to solve one. They don&amp;#8217;t want all the potentially relevant information thrown at them all at once; they just want what they need. And they want computers to make that determination for them. But hey, this isn&amp;#8217;t the first time those who predict our user experience needs have erred on the side of &lt;a href='http://www.pocket-lint.com/images/dynamic/NEWS-32125-b3a8b509bc5e3a074f7f240f57d71aa9.jpg'&gt;moar is better&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#8217;s it? That&amp;#8217;s the end of simultaneous streams? &lt;a href='http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/productivity_apps/240003296'&gt;Far from it&lt;/a&gt;. This once-disruptive technology now has a long journey down the Technology S Curve as it becomes the go-to solution for all the business intelligence and project analyst types that stumble across it, in other words, the late adopters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong. I&amp;#8217;m sure guilty of building &lt;a href='http://my.fcc.gov/'&gt;a dashboard&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Dashboard_Screen'&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; in my day. I&amp;#8217;m not saying that they&amp;#8217;ve never had a place. What I&amp;#8217;m saying is that today, not even the most complex dashboard could give you an accurate snapshot of its genus&amp;#8217;s future. If not dashes, then what? Beyond turning everything into a ubiquitous search box (&lt;em&gt;a la&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href='http://gov.uk'&gt;gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;), I&amp;#8217;m far from for a UI/UX expert, but I tend to think that startups generally have a pretty good sense of what&amp;#8217;s next. They have to. If they don&amp;#8217;t get it right the first time around, they tend not to have a second try. So what do we see?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Activity -&lt;/strong&gt; Social apps like Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, even GitHub are all built around the concept of activity. Whether its a news feed, recent checkins, or even commit activity, the question I come with is &amp;#8220;what&amp;#8217;s going on?&amp;#8221; and it gets answered as in depth as I care to scroll through, not as in depth as an engineer arbitrarily decided I needed a few years back. It&amp;#8217;s linear. It&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pyramid'&gt;inverted pyramid&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s customized by whom or what I follow, not by what I add or (re)arrange.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal&lt;/strong&gt; โ Productivity apps like Gmail, Google Reader, even dropbox don&amp;#8217;t summarize for me how many e-mails, unread posts, or free MB I have as soon as I log in, and with the exception of a few labs features here or there, don&amp;#8217;t even give me the option to have anything more than a bare-bones inbox, unread feed, or directory listing. In fact, GMail and Google Reader were recently criticized for &lt;a href='http://jonoscript.wordpress.com/2012/04/26/gmail-designer-arrogance-and-the-cult-of-minimalism/'&gt;going a bit too far&lt;/a&gt; in this direction. But the lesson is the same: just give me my stuff and get out of the way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immediate&lt;/strong&gt; - Transactional apps, like Uber or Square focus on action, not the past (or even the present). When I open the Uber or square apps, I&amp;#8217;m immediately presented with the ability to request a vehicle or swipe a card, not my top tasks, not an arbitrary array of options or metrics, not with recent news about the product or popular add-ons. The app simply stands at attention, awaiting orders. I actually had to dig a bit to find my transaction history and related business analytics, and I&amp;#8217;d argue that&amp;#8217;s a really good thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about the last time you&amp;#8217;ve used a drag-and-drop dashboard: If you&amp;#8217;re like me, it&amp;#8217;s going to be either Google Analytics or WordPress, and if that&amp;#8217;s the case, it&amp;#8217;s simply known as &lt;em&gt;the screen you see after you log in, but before you can do what you need to do&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s wasted pixels. It&amp;#8217;s cruft from a bygone era when clicks were expensive and developers were left wondering &amp;#8220;how can we fit more on a page&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Options are a crutch. It&amp;#8217;s the natural tendency of any engineer to over engineer a system, and that tendency is even stronger in a risk-averse, top-down culture &lt;a href='http://www.google.com/?q=dashboard+site:.gov'&gt;like government&lt;/a&gt;. But your job โ as an engineer, as a product manager, as user โ is to push back, to fight that urge, to make &lt;a href='http://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/'&gt;decisions, not options&lt;/a&gt;. Not convinced? That feature you can&amp;#8217;t &lt;a href='https://github.com/blog/1091-spring-cleaning'&gt;bring yourself to cut&lt;/a&gt;? Expose it through your API and see how many users complain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s no longer a question of &amp;#8220;is this possible technologically?&amp;#8221;. It&amp;#8217;s no longer a matter of &amp;#8220;can you expose me to that information 24/7?&amp;#8221;. Ever since the advent of &lt;a href='http://html5zombo.com/'&gt;Zombo com&lt;/a&gt;, the only limit is our imagination. We&amp;#8217;ve figured out the hard stuff. It&amp;#8217;s not centralization and personalization. It&amp;#8217;s decentralization and interoperability. Simplicity is the new black.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why You Should Always Write Software as Open Source, Even When It's Never Going to Be</title>

        <description>Liquid error: undefined method `gsub' for nil:NilClass</description>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='#note-2020-1' title='The same would apply when you'&gt;&lt;img alt='' src='#note-2020-1' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Unsatisfied with your contractor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two kinds of software: cludgy software and open source. Think about it logically. When you (or your organization) is the only person that&amp;#8217;s ever going to see something, you&amp;#8217;re a lot more likely to &amp;#8220;just make it work.&amp;#8221; After all, who would ever know? &lt;sup id='fnref:1'&gt;&lt;a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the same logic that applies to sweeping literal dirt under the rug doesn&amp;#8217;t apply to writing code. Whereas a rug will always serve to cover the floor, applications evolve over time and code is often constantly reused and repurposed as customers&amp;#8217; needs change. Simply put, it&amp;#8217;s impossible to predict today where your code is going to be a year from now and it&amp;#8217;s in your best interest to plan accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open source hedges this risk by distinguishing generic logic (say posting content online) from application-specific customization (say the use-case-specific presentation of that content). Yet when you&amp;#8217;re writing with the intention of producing proprietary or one-off code, you do everything in one pass. The true challenge arises when the same problem emerges again in another department, another business unit, or more generally in an even slightly different context. You&amp;#8217;re reinventing the wheel. You&amp;#8217;re &amp;#8220;open sourcing&amp;#8221; (even if within your organization). The solution? Always assume your software is going to be open source, even if you know it&amp;#8217;s never going to be, and here&amp;#8217;s why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible from the start&lt;/strong&gt; - Imagine you building a house and the contractor literally nails down all your furniture at the onset, saying you could always remove it before you sell. You&amp;#8217;d almost certainly hire a new contractor. Even if you&amp;#8217;re never going to sell the house, you may want to get a new couch, or at the very least change a room&amp;#8217;s layout somewhere down the line. Yet software developers do it all the time. We custom build solutions, and then go back and abstract logic to &amp;#8220;open source&amp;#8221; it as needed. You&amp;#8217;re doubling the effort. Keep logic separate from implementation-specific customization, and you&amp;#8217;ll have a shared, portable solution from day one. Put another way, your business unit is no way special or unique. The same logic that presents updates about the latest line of widgets to your customers can also be used to update the same customer base about cogs and you should prepare for that potential synergy from day one, even if not immediately realized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modular by design&lt;/strong&gt;- Distinguishing unrelated components encourages several coding best practices. In addition to introducing a modular design, meaning additional components could easily be added (or existing components removed) down the line, abstraction often yields objectively more stable and more readably maintainable code due to the abhorrence of the copy-and-paste effect. Put another way, you&amp;#8217;re forced to build elegant solutions โ the fact that others are not only going to see, but have to be able to use and adapt your code forces you to follow best-practices like name spacing, abstraction, and object oriented programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A message to your future self&lt;/strong&gt; โ Ever go back and look at old code, &lt;a href='https://twitter.com/BenBalter/status/209356982983999488'&gt;only to scratch your head&lt;/a&gt; as to what&amp;#8217;s going on? The same you that may be asking yourself what you were thinking when you got a tattoo five years back, is also going to be asking why you wrote that singleton function five years ago. Yet when you write open source, you mitigate that risk by explaining your code in such a way that others (including your future self) can understand it. In a world of system orientated architectures and ever-changing requirements, the chance that a software project is one-and-done is increasingly rare, not to mention the fact that by failing to properly document, you&amp;#8217;re introducing a significant risk of vendor lock in. Your successor will thank you, and so will the person paying the bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality of today&amp;#8217;s business environment is that all software is inherently &amp;#8220;open source&amp;#8221;, even if the scope of the sharing is limited to an organization. Assume the software is open, needs to be modular, and will be repurposed, and you will save significant costs in the long run. And when you require the same of outside contractors, you get better, more flexible code, and offset the risks of vendor or technology lock in in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justice Brandeis is famous for noting that &amp;#8220;sunlight is the best disinfectant.&amp;#8221; Likewise, the transparency afforded by the open-source ethos produces &lt;a href='http://www.coverity.com/library/pdf/coverity-scan-2011-open-source-integrity-report.pdf'&gt;more reliable software&lt;/a&gt; โ so why not simply assume your code is going to be open source from the start?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span /&gt;: http://ben.balter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/mike-holmes.jpeg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='footnotes'&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li id='fn:1'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same would apply when you&amp;#8217;re buying software and the contractor is under the impression no one outside the organization will ever see the code, and more importantly, the code could never negatively impact the public&amp;#8217;s perception of their overall work-product &lt;span&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.governmentciomagazine.com'&gt;&lt;img alt='' src='http://www.governmentciomagazine.com' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Despite increasing public support (as well as a number of executive mandates) publishing public data in a machine-readable format is not as simple as pressing the &amp;#8220;publish&amp;#8221; button. Why? Equally important as exposing the information itself is fostering a vibrant developer ecosystem around it. By making the publishing agency, not the public, responsible for making information immediately useful, government can lower the barriers associated with consuming its data and introduce additional citizen services at little to no cost to the agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Garbage in, garbage out.&lt;/strong&gt;Good, clean data may be surprisingly difficult to come by, especially when working with government systems that have been coupled together over decades. Data standards and conventions change, mechanisms of data collection evolve, and the data itself may be interpreted differently as new policies are introduced. As a result consistent practices, like naming conventions or data formats, often go overlooked. Where practical, take steps to normalize the data prior to release, rather than pushing the responsibility off to be inefficiently repeated by each application individually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Eat your own dog food.&lt;/strong&gt;When organizations consume the products they create, they empirically deliver better, more reliable, and more innovative products. You&amp;#8217;d never seek to buy a car from a dealer that&amp;#8217;s never driven one, yet we often expect the public to build applications based on APIs (Application Programming Interfaces โ how computers talk to one another) published by organizations that have never had to consume their own data. Rather than solving the same problem twice, start by exposing all relevant data through public APIs and then work backward to build internal applications that rely on those externally facing data feeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Data as a citizen service.&lt;/strong&gt;It is tempting to try and meet open data benchmarks, at least on face, by publishing snapshots of large datasets. Yet multi-gigabyte database exports do little to encourage external development, especially when such data-dumps are delayed and infrequent. Imagine the usefulness of a Facebook feed that showed your friends&amp;#8217; activity from last month. Datasets should be directly exposed so that the public has access to live, real-time data, either in its entirety, or through proper access controls. This not only allows agencies to deliver more useful information, but also reduces the need to store the same data in multiple formats and in multiple locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Curate discrete pieces of data.&lt;/strong&gt;APIs are most useful when they do the heavy lifting for those consuming them, especially in terms of sifting through large amounts of data. In practical terms that means returning data to the most discrete level possible, be it a single row, rather than merely returning a subset of the dataset, or even returning a single cell. Seemingly obvious but often overlooked, a query for the broadband speeds at a given address, for example, should return only the data relating to that address, not the entire city or even state-wide dataset. By allowing developers to query the data directly that means they will need less development time on their end, and thus a higher likelihood that an application will be built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Serve data in multiple formats.&lt;/strong&gt;When providing a service, whether you are a waiter or a CIO, &amp;#8220;the customer is always right.&amp;#8221; In the context of APIs, that means you need to return the information in the developers&amp;#8217; native tongue, not the server&amp;#8217;s. For some languages, heavyweight methods like XML may make sense, for others, especially mobile applications, JSON or JSONP may be preferred. Be prepared to return data in multiple formats, even as those formats continue to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Minimize the handshake learning curve&lt;/strong&gt;. Authentication may often be necessary, but the pain associated with it does not have to. Ensure that developers can easily register API keys, with minimal effort and without delay, and rely on common authentication frameworks (e.g., OAuth 2.0) to minimize the learning curve. Similarly, whenever practical, provide common API wrappers and other software development kits in multiple languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Encourage adoption through documentation.&lt;/strong&gt; Often, the most overlooked aspect of exposing data is documentation. Describe the structure of the data fully, including how to interpret it, and ensure that any technical documentation such as lists of methods and sample code is both complete and accurate. The only thing worse than not having documentation is having wrong documentation. The best APIs even provide Wikis to allow developers to share tools and best practices with one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Follow industry standards and convention&lt;/strong&gt;. Although APIs may just be beginning to take foothold in government, a set of best practices have quietly evolved in the private sector over the past several years. What may seem like small, technicalities, such as a truly RESTful API or using proper HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, for example, can mean the difference between useful and useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Bake in Analytics&lt;/strong&gt;. When it comes to garnering support for future efforts, nothing can be more powerful than raw numbers. From the ground up, bake in analytics on both the application level (what applications are querying the API?), and across APIs on the dataset levels (what APIs are being used?). This will help establish data-driven priorities, such as what type of data may be a good candidate for future APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Location, location, location.&lt;/strong&gt;With the &amp;#8220;consumerization&amp;#8221; of mobile, datasets are increasingly becoming location based. It&amp;#8217;s not what datasets are out there, but rather, what datasets are out there about my immediate world. Likewise, government datasets are increasingly about where, just as much as it is about what. It&amp;#8217;s important that this reality be taken into account when building APIs by incorporating geospatial lookups within the API, such a relying on MongoDB or other location-aware data structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exposing data as a service is quickly becoming an industry-standard practice. Many popular startups owe their success to the vibrant app communities that surround them, grown simply by lifting some of the burden off of developers&amp;#8217; shoulders. Government agencies may not yet be able to publish data with the mere click of a button, but when done right from the start, exposing additional data sources may be a more trivial task than many expect, and will in turn deliver value to citizens in ways today unimagined by agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Fix typo.&amp;#8221; Not quite &amp;#8220;one small step for man,&amp;#8221; but a significant first nonetheless. These simple words, typed by an open-source developer operating under the pseudonym &amp;#8220;iceeey,&amp;#8221; may represent the first collaborative effort between the federal government and the broader open-source community, and surely represents a tangible win for the open-government movement as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is in a unique position. As the youngest federal agency, they have the opportunity to reimagine many day-to-day business processes for an internet era, and to share that innovation across government. One such process is the means by which federal employees apply for and receive subsidies to offset the cost of public transportation to and from work. Having created an application that alleviated the need to shuttle time-consuming, paper-based forms from building to building within their own agency, the Bureau sought to package up the solution, and publicly release the source code for other federal agencies to use and expand upon. The logic was simple: solve the problem once, solve it everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the code was not simply made available for government employees to access. The code was placed on &lt;a href='http://github.com/'&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; โ a popular source code sharing service โ for anyone to download and explore, and within days of CFPB publishing its &lt;a href='http://www.consumerfinance.gov/blog/the-cfpbs-source-code-policy-open-and-shared/'&gt;recently announced Source Code Policy&lt;/a&gt;, someone did just that.GitHub user &amp;#8220;iceeey&amp;#8221; &lt;a href='https://github.com/cfpb/transit_subsidy/pull/1'&gt;submitted a proposed change&lt;/a&gt; โ known in developer parlance as &amp;#8220;forking the project&amp;#8221; and submitting a &amp;#8220;pull request&amp;#8221; โ correcting a misspelling on the form initially presented to new employees (&amp;#8220;roundtrip&amp;#8221; was accidentally spelled &amp;#8220;rountrip&amp;#8221;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly a minor change (&amp;#8220;one small step for grammar?&amp;#8221;), but notable for the underlying first that it represents: the opportunity to create efficiencies across government by partnering with the broader community of civically engaged developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open-source software (software for which the underlying source code is made publicly available) as a vehicle for a more open and more efficient government is nothing new. Behind the scenes, countless agencies rely on open-source software for various business functions, and many have even chosen to publicly publish the source code underlying the applications that they themselves have built in-house to tackle unique challenges. But this seemingly innocuous missing &amp;#8220;d&amp;#8221; and its subsequently submitted fix represents the first time a federal agency has directly collaborated with open-source developers to better its own day-to-day tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iceeey has &lt;a href='https://github.com/cfpb/transit_subsidy/pull/2'&gt;already submitted his second pull request&lt;/a&gt; (&amp;#8220;more typos&amp;#8221; he joked with an emoticon smiley), and I hope more agencies and more open-source developers will follow suit. Such collaborations empower agencies to do more with less; put better, more robust tools in the hands of federal employees as they carry out agency mission; and undoubtedly represent a giant-leap forward for a more open and more efficient government.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        <description>Liquid error: undefined method `gsub' for nil:NilClass</description>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt='' src='http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/news/PublishingImages/CFPB.jpg' /&gt;Most often, when we talk about open source in government, it&amp;#8217;s talked about in one of two ways: either it&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/11/29/towards-a-more-agile-government/'&gt;the pitfalls of the federal IT procurement model&lt;/a&gt; that can&amp;#8217;t seem to comprehend a world in which open-source is an option, much less potentially a superior choice (&lt;a href='http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/09/open-source-government-it-goscon.html'&gt;&amp;#8220;acquisition as a roadblock&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221;), or it&amp;#8217;s reiterating the same open-source talking points that haven&amp;#8217;t seemed to give open source much parity with the wall of organizational inertia proprietary software seems to have gained over the years (&amp;#8221;&lt;a href='http://benbalter.github.com/open-source-alternatives/'&gt;open source as an alternative&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href='http://cfpb.gov'&gt;Consumer Financial Protection Bureau&lt;/a&gt; (CFPB), however, is in a unique position. As the newest kid on the block, it&amp;#8217;s one of the few government agencies to have been born in a digital era, and more importantly, without the bureaucratic baggage that all too often stymies innovation. They have a chance to &amp;#8220;do it right&amp;#8221; from the startโฆ and they&amp;#8217;re doing just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Agency Born of the Internet Generation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, CFPB &lt;a href='http://www.consumerfinance.gov/developers/sourcecodepolicy/'&gt;announced a bureau-wide preference for open source&lt;/a&gt; in its shiny new &lt;a href='http://www.consumerfinance.gov/developers/sourcecodepolicy/'&gt;Source Code Policy&lt;/a&gt;, by my &lt;a href='http://www.google.com/search?sugexp=chrome,mod=4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;q=source+code+policy+site%3A.gov'&gt;crude research&lt;/a&gt;, a first for any government agency. There are two watershed shifts here: first, that the agency not only should, but &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; evaluate open source software on equal footing to its proprietary counterparts, a comparison which I believe will &lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/The-Wealth-Networks-Production-ebook/dp/B0015GWX0S'&gt;increasingly fall in open source&amp;#8217;s favor&lt;/a&gt;, and second, that unless there&amp;#8217;s an overriding security or similar concern &lt;em&gt;not to&lt;/em&gt;, public code must be public. There&amp;#8217;s nothing new here. All it says is that we should use the best software for the job (a no-brainier), and that that software, the public&amp;#8217;s property, should belong to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why is this news? Plenty of government entities have &lt;a href='http://www.fcc.gov/blog/contributing-code-back-fcc-govs-open-source-feedback-loop'&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href='http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/02/11/whitehousegov-releases-second-set-open-source-code'&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href='http://open.nasa.gov'&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href='https://update.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/open-source-procurement-toolkit'&gt;encouraged the&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.finance.gov.au/e-government/infrastructure/docs/AGuidetoOpenSourceSoftware.pdf'&gt;use of open&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href='http://www.tekno.dk/pdf/projekter/p03_opensource_paper_english.pdf'&gt;source software&lt;/a&gt;. But no one has come out and &lt;a href='https://twitter.com/#!/victorzapanta/status/189390759181557760'&gt;plainly stated that they were an &amp;#8220;open-source agency&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;, that open source is the new default, and that absent an affirmative step by some nay-sayer, that the public will have access to their code.That&amp;#8217;s huge. It&amp;#8217;s flipping the burden, and it&amp;#8217;s the way things should be from the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But Where&amp;#8217;s the Beef?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, there&amp;#8217;s one thing the source code policy is noticeably silent on: &lt;em&gt;the ecosystem&lt;/em&gt;. Posting code is great and it&amp;#8217;s great that they&amp;#8217;ve done the legal legwork so other agencies can follow suit, but that&amp;#8217;s just the 1.0. The true power of open source comes not from simply publishing code, but from being a member of a broader coding community. Can a CFPB employee contribute a patch to an existing open source project on CFPB time? &lt;sup id='fnref:1'&gt;&lt;a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; What about contributing to a CFPB project once he or she&amp;#8217;s left? What happens to my rights when I fork a &lt;a href='http://github.com/cfpb'&gt;CFPB project on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and send the agency a pull request? &lt;sup id='fnref:2'&gt;&lt;a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Can the agency even accept my code legally? &lt;sup id='fnref:3'&gt;&lt;a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; There&amp;#8217;s a lot of legal ambiguity there, and it&amp;#8217;s just the kind of legal ambiguity a well-intentioned government attorney can seize upon to gum up the very gears that are driving this incredible move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve seen the same progression in the open data world. The 1.0 is posting 10 XML files at a gigabyte each โ an arms-length relationship with developers โ arguably open data simply for open data&amp;#8217;s sake. The secret sauce lies in the relationship, in publishing APIs and web services rather than static data, to build an ecosystem around the agency&amp;#8217;s work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Innovation Ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine if government agencies served as the catalyst for a &lt;a href='http://ben.balter.com/2012/03/05/wordpress-for-government-and-enterprise/#p[NssBlW]'&gt;joint public-private effort to drive tomorrow&amp;#8217;s innovation&lt;/a&gt;. We saw this during the space race, and see it today in terms of government-funded research, but by-and-large, open-source coders have yet to be included. Sure we&amp;#8217;ve seen the &amp;#8220;let&amp;#8217;s have some open-source developers build this for us for free&amp;#8221; type challenges, but that&amp;#8217;s about it. There&amp;#8217;s no ecosystem, no community, no push-pull or give-and-take, and I&amp;#8217;m worried that as CFPB&amp;#8217;s efforts federate across government, this nuance may not federate along with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agency&amp;#8217;s already got &lt;a href='https://github.com/cfpb/transit_subsidy/pull/1'&gt;it&amp;#8217;s first public-generated code contribution&lt;/a&gt;, and can expect at least one more on &lt;a href='https://gist.github.com/2343578'&gt;their gist of the policy&lt;/a&gt; (Ed. note: does CFPB not &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; a Blue Book?!), but the possibility of such a relationship with the citizenry doesn&amp;#8217;t seem contemplated by the policy, let alone included as integrally as it should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d love to see the next iteration of the policy have a third section, &amp;#8220;III. Membership in the Open-Source Community&amp;#8221; on not just publishing code they&amp;#8217;ve developed in house โ don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong, that&amp;#8217;s huge โ but actually &lt;em&gt;contributing&lt;/em&gt;meaningful code to the broader ecosystem, and working directly with the open-source community to foster an active partnership that delivers the best citizen services possible. It&amp;#8217;s a dialog, not a code dump. There needs to be a conversation there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Procure, Publish, Participate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s the realization that when you use open-source software, you&amp;#8217;re not a customer. You&amp;#8217;re a member of a community. You&amp;#8217;re invited to a pot-luck dinner. There&amp;#8217;s not the same sense of entitlement you have with proprietary software. It&amp;#8217;s not that they owe you a given feature. There&amp;#8217;s no financial transaction there. It&amp;#8217;s that that feature hasn&amp;#8217;t been developed yet, but can be, the same way every other feature has evolved, through community contributions. There&amp;#8217;s an entirely different philosophy driving the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For open source in government to work, it&amp;#8217;s got to move beyond procuring community contributed open-source projects on the one hand, and releasing open-source code developed in house distinctly on the other. It&amp;#8217;s about feeling a sense of belonging. It&amp;#8217;s about the agency taking on a sense of ownership in the broader project. It&amp;#8217;s about participation. &lt;sup id='fnref:4'&gt;&lt;a href='#fn:4' rel='footnote'&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think CFPB gets it in a big way, and the fact that this is memorialized in writing is a major step in the right direction. They&amp;#8217;ve got the basic mechanics down โ procure openโsource projects, publish open-source code โ but the missing secret sauce that would really drive the policy home? Participate in the open-source community as a matter of policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;+1 CFPB, +1. &lt;em&gt;Welcome to the community.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='footnotes'&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li id='fn:1'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In simple terms, the core of open-source projects (as distinct from community-contributed plugins or modules) are primarily fueled by &amp;#8220;patches&amp;#8221; (small code change sets) in response to bugs or feature requests, that get committed to the project&amp;#8217;s codebase and released in subsequent versions. &lt;span&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href='#fnref:1' rev='footnote'&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id='fn:2'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the project is licensed as government work, are my code contributions now government work? Are the government employee lines of code under a broader license, while mine are under a more restrictive license like GPL or apache? &lt;span&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href='#fnref:2' rev='footnote'&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id='fn:3'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this considered a donation for Federal ethics purposes thus requiring disclosure? &lt;span&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href='#fnref:3' rev='footnote'&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id='fn:4'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can manifest itself in lots of different ways, but most tangibly: going to local meetups and conferences (or hosting them); contributing to the project&amp;#8217;s core by introducing new features, documentation, or posting to support forums; abstracting business logic from the start to be more broadly applicable to other developers; outreach and evangelism; and fostering relationships with key stakeholders within the community &lt;span&gt;27&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href='#fnref:4' rev='footnote'&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
